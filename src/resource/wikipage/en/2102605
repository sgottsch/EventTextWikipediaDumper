==Early life==
In junior high school, Akiyama practiced [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] and in senior high school he did [[sport wrestling|freestyle amateur wrestling]] and [[judo]]. After high school he went to [[Senshu University]] in [[Tokyo]]. There he joined an amateur wrestling team that produced other professional wrestlers [[Riki Choshu]], [[Hiroshi Hase]] and [[Manabu Nakanishi]].

==Professional wrestling career==
===All Japan Pro Wrestling (1992–2000)===
Akiyama had great success as an amateur wrestler and was eventually scouted by [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW). He made his professional wrestling debut in September 1992 in a match against [[Kenta Kobashi]], which he lost.<ref name=NOAHbio/> He gradually rose in rank, earning a trial series in January 1993. Afterwards, Akiyama started competition in tag teams. The tag team division soon became his specialty, teaming with [[Takao Omori]] against Kenta Kobashi and Mitsuharu Misawa. On more than one occasion, [[Dave Meltzer]] rated the matches they had together five stars. In 1995, he split with Taue, and was selected to be Misawa's partner after he split with Kobashi. The two teamed together successfully and won the [[World Tag Team Championship (AJPW)|World Tag Team Championship]] during 1996. Akiyama and Misawa also competed in the [[World's Strongest Tag Determination League]] tournaments in 1996 and 1997, but lost in successive years to the team of [[The Holy Demon Army|Toshiaki Kawada and Akira Taue]]. Akiyama then began closing in on the [[Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship]], first challenging Misawa in September 1997, again challenging Misawa in January 1998, Kobashi in July 1998 and Vader in January 2000. He was unsuccessful on all occasions, and never managed to capture the championship.

After teaming with Misawa, Akiyama began teaming with [[Kenta Kobashi]] to form '[[Burning (professional wrestling)|Burning]]'. The team won numerous tag team titles and competed against the teams of Mitsuharu Misawa and Yoshinari Ogawa, Toshiaki Kawada and Akira Taue, Yoshihiro Takayama and Takao Omori and others. Burning also won the World's Strongest Tag Determination League tournament in 1998 by defeating the team of [[Stan Hansen]] and Vader, and again in 1999 by defeating Akira Taue and Stan Hansen. Akiyama's last major victory in All Japan Pro Wrestling was on February 27, 2000, when he defeated former tag team partner [[Mitsuharu Misawa]] by pinfall in a heated and highly acclaimed contest.

===Pro Wrestling Noah (2000–2012)===
After a controversy in AJPW over the direction and management, he left the company with [[Mitsuharu Misawa]], and half the roster, for Misawa's newly created [[Pro Wrestling Noah]] in mid-2000. Like many other members who made the jump, Akiyama gave himself a makeover, dropping his trademark blue and white trimmed boots and blue trunks for white boots and trunks and dyed his hair brown. He was quickly established as a top star of the company, winning both falls in the main event of NOAH's first show, choking out [[Kenta Kobashi]] in the second Noah show the night after he turned heel for this first time in his career, and becoming the second [[GHC Heavyweight Championship|GHC Heavyweight Champion]], He had stellar title defenses in [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] against [[Yuji Nagata]] and [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]]. But a lack of worthy contenders eventually forced Noah to abandon his push, using [[Yoshinari Ogawa]] to transition the title back to Misawa. He continued work in Noah as a tag team competitor again to critical acclaim, winning the [[GHC Tag Team Championship]] with [[Akitoshi Saito]].

In April 2004, he created the [[GHC Openweight Hardcore Championship]] to get back into singles competitions, and adapting an attitude manifested by wearing trunks that were odd colors for him. These motives helped put him back into contention for the GHC title against Kenta Kobashi, which was voted as Match of the Year. Late 2004 and much of 2005 were highlighted by his feud with protégé [[Makoto Hashi]] where Akiyama used "tough love" to toughen up young Hashi. On January 22, 2006, Akiyama defeated [[Akira Taue]] to become the GHC Heavyweight Champion for the second time, defending the title against [[Minoru Suzuki]] on March 5 and [[Masao Inoue]] on April 24. Akiyama was defeated by [[Naomichi Marufuji]] on Noah's September 9 [[Nippon Budokan]] show in his third defense of the GHC Heavyweight Title.

Following his title loss to Naomichi Marufuji, Akiyama made good his promise to [[Tsuyoshi Kikuchi]], going back to wearing blue trunks, and wrestling mainly in the undercard. He successfully redeemed himself by defeating Kikuchi and once again wore white trunks following that match. This put him back in line for success, which had him winning the tag titles a second time with [[Takeshi Rikio]]. However, due to an injury to Rikio, they were forced to vacate the titles. Akiyama competed at [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]]'s third Annual "Wrestle Kingdom in Tokyo Dome" show, defeating [[Manabu Nakanishi]].

On March 1, 2009, Akiyama defeated [[Kensuke Sasaki]] for the GHC Heavyweight Championship. On June 14, 2009, he was forced to vacate the title due to injury, in which left him out of action for the rest of the tour. After making his return later that year, Akiyama continued to wrestle sporadically whilst struggling with back injuries and the burden of [[post traumatic stress syndrome]], following the death of Mitsuharu Misawa.

Akiyama participated in the first [[Global League Tournament]], achieving a total of eight points with four wins and just one loss. As the Block B winner, he faced Block A winner [[Yoshihiro Takayama]] in the final match on May 2. Takayama won the tournament by pinning Akiyama with an Everest German suplex.

In April 2011, Akiyama and Akitoshi Saito won the [[Global Tag League#2011|2011 Global Tag League]].<ref name=GlobalTagLeague2011>{{cite web|title=Global Tag Team League Tournament 2011|url=http://www.noah-usa.cc/Global%20Tag%20Team%20Tournament%202011.html|work=[[Pro Wrestling Noah]]|accessdate=2011-04-29}}</ref>
