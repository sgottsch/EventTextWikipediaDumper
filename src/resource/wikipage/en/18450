<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Lung cancer''', also known as '''lung carcinoma''',<ref name="Merck" /> is a malignant [[lung tumor]] characterized by uncontrolled [[cell growth]] in [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] of the [[lung]]. If left untreated, this growth can spread beyond the lung by process of [[metastasis]] into nearby tissue or other parts of the body.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Falk | first1=S | last2=Williams | first2=C | title=Lung Cancer&mdash;the facts | edition=3rd | chapter=Chapter 1 | pages=3&ndash;4 | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-19-956933-5 }}</ref> Most [[cancer]]s that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are [[carcinomas]] that derive from [[epithelium|epithelial]] cells. The main primary types are [[small-cell lung carcinoma]] (SCLC) and [[non-small-cell lung carcinoma]] (NSCLC). The most common [[symptom]]s are coughing (including [[Hemoptysis|coughing up blood]]), weight loss, shortness of breath, and [[chest pain]]s.<ref name="Harrison" />

<!-- Cause and diagnosis -->
The vast majority (85%) of cases of lung cancer are due to long-term exposure to [[tobacco smoking|tobacco smoke]].<ref name="Merck" /> About 10–15% of cases occur in people who have never smoked.<ref name="Thun" /> These cases are often caused by a combination of [[genetics|genetic factors]]<ref name="MurrayNadel46" /> and exposure to [[radon]] gas,<ref name="MurrayNadel46" /> [[asbestos]],<ref name="O'Reilly" /> or other forms of [[air pollution]],<ref name="MurrayNadel46" /> including [[passive smoking|second-hand smoke]].<ref name="AUTOREF" /><ref name="AUTOREF1" /> Lung cancer may be seen on [[chest radiograph]]s and [[computed tomography]] (CT) scans. The [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] is confirmed by [[biopsy]]<ref name="Holland-Frei78" /> which is usually performed by [[bronchoscopy]] or CT-guidance.

<!-- Treatment, prognosis and epidemiology -->
Treatment and long-term outcomes depend on the type of cancer, the [[staging (pathology)|stage]] (degree of spread), and the person's overall health, measured by [[performance status]]. Common treatments include [[surgery]], [[chemotherapy]], and [[radiation therapy|radiotherapy]]. NSCLC is sometimes treated with surgery, whereas SCLC usually responds better to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.<ref>{{cite book | last=Chapman | first=S |author2=Robinson G |author3=Stradling J |author4=West S  | title=Oxford Handbook of Respiratory Medicine | edition=2nd | chapter=Chapter 31 | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2009 | isbn=978-0-19-954516-2 }}</ref> Overall, 16.8% of people in the United States diagnosed with lung cancer [[Five-year survival rate|survive five years]] after the diagnosis,<ref name="SEER">{{cite web | title=Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program | url=http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/lungb.html | website=National Cancer Institute | accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref> while outcomes on average are worse in the developing world.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms which may suggest lung cancer include:<ref name="Harrison" />
* Respiratory symptoms: [[coughing]], [[hemoptysis|coughing up blood]], [[wheeze|wheezing]], or [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]]
* Systemic symptoms: weight loss, [[weakness]], [[fever]], or [[Nail clubbing|clubbing]] of the fingernails
* Symptoms due to the cancer mass pressing on adjacent structures: chest pain, [[bone pain]], [[superior vena cava obstruction]], or [[dysphagia|difficulty swallowing]]

If the cancer grows in the [[airway]]s, it may obstruct airflow, causing [[dyspnea|breathing difficulties]]. The obstruction can lead to accumulation of secretions behind the blockage, and predispose to [[pneumonia]].<ref name="Harrison" />

Depending on the type of tumor, [[Paraneoplastic syndrome|paraneoplastic phenomena]]—symptoms not due to the local presence of cancer—may initially attract attention to the disease.<ref name="Honnorat" /> In lung cancer, these phenomena may include [[hypercalcemia]], [[syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone]] (SIADH, abnormally concentrated urine and diluted blood), ectopic [[ACTH]] production, or [[Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome]] (muscle weakness due to [[autoimmune disorder|autoantibodies]]). Tumors in the [[Apex of lung|top of the lung]], known as [[Pancoast tumor]]s, may invade the local part of the [[sympathetic nervous system]], leading to [[Horner's syndrome]] (dropping of the eyelid and a small pupil on that side), as well as damage to the [[brachial plexus]].<ref name="Harrison" />

Many of the symptoms of lung cancer (poor appetite, weight loss, fever, fatigue) are not specific.<ref name="Holland-Frei78" /> In many people, the cancer has already spread beyond the original site by the time they have symptoms and seek medical attention.<ref name="ajcc" /> Symptoms that suggest the presence of metastatic disease include weight loss, bone pain and neurological symptoms (headaches, [[syncope (medicine)|fainting]], [[convulsion]]s, or limb weakness).<ref name="Harrison" /> Common sites of spread include the brain, bone, [[adrenal gland]]s, opposite lung, liver, [[pericardium]], and [[kidney]]s.<ref name="ajcc" /> About 10% of people with lung cancer do not have symptoms at diagnosis; these cancers are incidentally found on routine chest radiography.<ref name="Collins" />

==Causes==
[[Image:Cancer smoking lung cancer correlation from NIH.svg|thumb|Graph showing how a general increase in sales of tobacco products in the USA in the first four decades of the 20th century (cigarettes per person per year) led to a corresponding rapid increase in the rate of lung cancer during the 1930s, '40s and '50s (lung cancer deaths per 100,000 male population per year)]]
Cancer develops following genetic damage to [[DNA]] and epigenetic changes. These changes affect the normal functions of the cell, including cell proliferation, programmed cell death ([[apoptosis]]) and DNA repair. As more damage accumulates, the risk of cancer increases.<ref name="Holland-Frei8">{{Cite book  |vauthors=Brown KM, Keats JJ, Sekulic A, etal | title=Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine | publisher=People's Medical Publishing House USA | year=2010 | chapter=Chapter 8 | edition=8th | isbn=978-1-60795-014-1 }}</ref>

===Radon gas===
[[Radon]] is a colourless and odorless [[gas]] generated by the breakdown of radioactive [[radium]], which in turn is the decay product of [[uranium]], found in the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. The radiation decay products [[ion]]ize genetic material, causing mutations that sometimes turn cancerous.

*Some products of combustion (incomplete combustion, coal (indoor emissions from household coal burning), coal gasification, coal-tar pitch, [[Coke (fuel)|coke production]], soot, diesel engine exhaust)
* Ionizing radiation (X-radiation, [[gamma radiation]], [[plutonium]])
* Some toxic gases (methyl ether (technical grade), Bis-(chloromethyl) ether, [[sulfur mustard]], MOPP ([[Mustargen Oncovin Procarbazine Prednisone|vincristine-prednisone-nitrogen mustard-procarbazine mixture]]), fumes from painting)
* Rubber production and crystalline [[Silicon dioxide|silica dust]]

The [[epidermal growth factor receptor]] (EGFR) regulates cell proliferation, [[apoptosis]], [[angiogenesis]], and tumor invasion.<ref name="NEJM-molecular" /> Mutations and amplification of EGFR are common in non-small-cell lung carcinoma and provide the basis for treatment with EGFR-inhibitors. [[Her2/neu]] is affected less frequently.<ref name="NEJM-molecular" /> Other genes that are often mutated or amplified are ''[[c-MET]]'', ''[[NKX2-1]]'', ''[[LKB1]]'', ''[[PIK3CA]]'', and ''[[BRAF (gene)|BRAF]]''.<ref name="NEJM-molecular" />

The cell lines of origin are not fully understood.<ref name="Harrison" /> The mechanism may involve abnormal activation of [[stem cell]]s. In the proximal airways, stem cells that express [[keratin 5]] are more likely to be affected, typically leading to squamous-cell lung carcinoma. In the middle airways, implicated stem cells include [[club cell]]s and [[neuroepithelial cell]]s that express [[uteroglobin|club cell secretory protein]].

Metastasis of lung cancer requires transition from epithelial to [[mesenchyme|mesenchymal]] cell type.

[[Image:Thorax CT peripheres Brronchialcarcinom li OF.jpg|thumb|[[CT scan]] showing a cancerous tumor in the left lung]]
Performing a [[chest radiograph]] is one of the first investigative steps if a person reports symptoms that may suggest lung cancer. This may reveal an obvious mass, widening of the [[mediastinum]] (suggestive of spread to [[lymph node]]s there), [[atelectasis]] (collapse), consolidation ([[pneumonia]]) or [[pleural effusion]].<ref name="Merck" /> [[X-ray computed tomography|CT imaging]] is typically used to provide more information about the type and extent of disease. [[Bronchoscopy]] or CT-guided [[biopsy]] is often used to sample the tumor for [[histopathology]].<ref name="Collins" />

Lung cancer often appears as a [[solitary pulmonary nodule]] on a chest radiograph. However, the [[differential diagnosis]] is wide. Many other diseases can also give this appearance, including [[tuberculosis]], fungal infections, metastatic cancer or [[organizing pneumonia]]. Less common causes of a solitary pulmonary nodule include [[hamartoma]]s, [[bronchogenic cyst]]s, [[adenoma]]s, [[arteriovenous malformation]], [[pulmonary sequestration]], [[rheumatoid nodule]]s, [[granulomatosis with polyangiitis]], or [[lymphoma]].<ref>{{Cite book | last=Miller |first=WT | title=Fishman's Pulmonary Diseases and Disorders | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2008 | page=486 | edition=4th | isbn=0-07-145739-9 }}</ref> Lung cancer can also be an [[incidentaloma|incidental finding]], as a solitary pulmonary nodule on a chest radiograph or CT scan done for an unrelated reason.<ref name="Fishman1815">{{Cite book | last=Kaiser | first=LR | title=Fishman's Pulmonary Diseases and Disorders | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2008 | pages=1815–1816 | edition=4th | isbn=0-07-145739-9 }}</ref> The definitive diagnosis of lung cancer is based on [[histopathology|histological]] examination of the suspicious tissue<ref name="Harrison" /> in the context of the clinical and radiological features.<ref name="Holland-Frei78" />

Lung cancers are classified according to [[histopathology|histological type]].<ref name="Holland-Frei78" /> This classification is important for determining management and predicting outcomes of the disease. Lung cancers are [[carcinoma]]s—malignancies that arise from [[epithelial cell]]s. Lung carcinomas are categorized by the size and appearance of the malignant cells seen by a histopathologist under a [[microscope]]. For therapeutic purposes, two broad classes are distinguished: [[non-small-cell lung carcinoma]] and [[small-cell lung carcinoma]].<ref name="Robbins" />

====Non-small-cell lung carcinoma====
[[Image:Squamous carcinoma lung 2 cytology.jpg|thumb|left|[[Micrograph]] of [[squamous-cell carcinoma]], a type of non-small-cell carcinoma, [[FNA specimen]], [[Pap stain]]]]

The three main subtypes of NSCLC are [[Adenocarcinoma of the lung|adenocarcinoma]], [[squamous-cell lung carcinoma|squamous-cell carcinoma]] and [[large-cell lung carcinoma|large-cell carcinoma]].<ref name="Harrison" />

Nearly 40% of lung cancers are adenocarcinoma, which usually originates in peripheral lung tissue.<ref name="Holland-Frei78">{{cite book | vauthors=Lu C, Onn A, Vaporciyan AA, etal | title=Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine | edition=8th | chapter=78: Cancer of the Lung | publisher=People's Medical Publishing House | year=2010 |isbn=978-1-60795-014-1 }}</ref> Although most cases of adenocarcinoma are associated with smoking, adenocarcinoma is also the most common form of lung cancer among people who have smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes ("never-smokers")<ref name="Harrison" /><ref name="Subramanian">{{cite journal | last=Subramanian | first=J |author2=Govindan R  |title=Lung cancer in never smokers: a review | journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume=25 | issue=5 | pages=561–570| publisher=American Society of Clinical Oncology |date=February 2007 | pmid=17290066 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2006.06.8015 }}</ref> and ex-smokers with a modest smoking history.<ref name="Harrison" /> A subtype of adenocarcinoma, the [[bronchioloalveolar carcinoma]], is more common in female never-smokers, and may have a better long-term survival.<ref name="Raz"/>

Squamous-cell carcinoma accounts for about 30% of lung cancers. They typically occur close to large airways. A hollow cavity and associated [[necrosis|cell death]] are commonly found at the centre of the tumor.<ref name="Holland-Frei78" /> About 9% of lung cancers are large-cell carcinoma. These are so named because the cancer cells are large, with excess [[cytoplasm]], large [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] and conspicuous [[nucleolus|nucleoli]].<ref name="Holland-Frei78" />

====Small-cell lung carcinoma====

[[Image:Lung small cell carcinoma (1) by core needle biopsy.jpg|thumb|left|Small-cell lung carcinoma (microscopic view of a core needle biopsy)]]

In [[small-cell lung carcinoma]] (SCLC), the cells contain dense neurosecretory granules ([[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] containing [[neuroendocrine]] [[hormone]]s), which give this tumor an endocrine/paraneoplastic syndrome association.<ref name="Rosti" /> Most cases arise in the larger airways (primary and secondary [[bronchus|bronchi]]).<ref name="Collins" /> Sixty to seventy percent have extensive disease (which cannot be targeted within a single radiation therapy field) at presentation.<ref name="Harrison" />

====Others====

Four main histological subtypes are recognised, although some cancers may contain a combination of different subtypes,<ref name=Robbins>{{cite book | last1=Kumar | first1=V | author2=Abbas AK | author3=Aster JC | year=2013 | title=Robbins Basic Pathology |edition=9th | publisher=Elsevier Saunders | pages=505 | chapter=12 | isbn=978-1-4377-1781-5 }}</ref> such as adenosquamous carcinoma.<ref name="Holland-Frei78" /> Rare subtypes include [[lung carcinoid|carcinoid tumors]], bronchial gland carcinomas and sarcomatoid carcinomas.<ref name="Holland-Frei78" />

===Metastasis===

The lung is a common place for the spread of tumors from other parts of the body. Secondary cancers are classified by the site of origin; e.g., breast cancer that has spread to the lung is called metastatic breast cancer. Metastases often have a characteristic round appearance on chest radiograph.<ref name="Seo" />

Primary lung cancers themselves most commonly metastasize to the brain, bones, liver and [[adrenal gland]]s.<ref name="Holland-Frei78" /> [[Immunostaining]] of a biopsy is often helpful to determine the original source.<ref name="pmid18784820">{{cite journal |author=Tan D, Zander DS |title=Immunohistochemistry for Assessment of Pulmonary and Pleural Neoplasms: A Review and Update |journal=Int J Clin Exp Pathol |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=19–31 |year=2008|pmid=18784820 |pmc=2480532 }}</ref> The presence of [[Napsin-A]], [[TTF-1]], CK7 and CK20 are helpful in confirming the subtype of lung carcinoma. SCLC derived from neuroendocrine cells may express [[CD56]], [[neural cell adhesion molecule]], [[synaptophysin]] or [[chromogranin]].<ref name="Harrison" />

===Staging===
{{see also|Lung cancer staging}}

Lung [[cancer staging]] is an assessment of the degree of spread of the cancer from its original source.<ref name="Holland-Frei2">{{cite book | vauthors=Connolly JL, Goldsmith JD, Wang HH, etal | title=Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine | edition=8th | chapter=37: Principles of Cancer Pathology | publisher=People's Medical Publishing House | year=2010 |isbn=978-1-60795-014-1 }}</ref> It is one of the factors affecting the [[prognosis]] and potential treatment of lung cancer.<ref name="Harrison" /><ref name="Holland-Frei2" />

The evaluation of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) staging uses the [[TNM staging system|TNM classification]]. This is based on the size of the primary '''t'''umor, lymph '''n'''ode involvement, and distant '''m'''etastasis.<ref name="Harrison" />

Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) has traditionally been classified as "limited stage" (confined to one half of the chest and within the scope of a single tolerable [[radiotherapy]] field) or "extensive stage" (more widespread disease).<ref name="Harrison" /> However, the TNM classification and grouping are useful in estimating prognosis.<ref name="Rami-Porta" />

For both NSCLC and SCLC, the two general types of staging evaluations are clinical staging and surgical staging. Clinical staging is performed prior to definitive surgery. It is based on the results of imaging studies (such as [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scans]] and [[positron emission tomography|PET scans]]) and biopsy results. Surgical staging is evaluated either during or after the operation, and is based on the combined results of surgical and clinical findings, including surgical sampling of thoracic lymph nodes.<ref name="Holland-Frei78" />

==Management==
{{main|Treatment of lung cancer}}
Treatment for lung cancer depends on the cancer's specific cell type, how far it has [[cancer staging|spread]], and the person's [[performance status]]. Common treatments include [[palliative care]],<ref>{{cite journal | last=Ferrell | first=B |author2=Koczywas M |author3=Grannis F |author4=Harrington A  | title=Palliative care in lung cancer | journal=Surgical Clinics of North America | volume=91 | issue=2 | pages=403–417 |date=April 2011 | pmid=21419260 | doi=10.1016/j.suc.2010.12.003}}</ref> [[surgery]], [[chemotherapy]], and [[radiation therapy]].<ref name="Harrison" /> [[Targeted therapy of lung cancer]] is growing in importance for advanced lung cancer.

===Surgery===
{{main|Lung cancer surgery}}
[[Image:Lung cancer.jpg|thumb|[[Pneumonectomy]] specimen containing a [[squamous-cell carcinoma]], seen as a white area near the bronchi]]

If investigations confirm NSCLC, the [[cancer staging|stage]] is assessed to determine whether the disease is localized and amenable to surgery or if it has spread to the point where it cannot be cured surgically. CT scan and [[positron emission tomography]] are used for this determination.<ref name="Harrison" /> If mediastinal lymph node involvement is suspected, [[mediastinoscopy]] may be used to sample the nodes and assist staging.<ref name="Fishman1853">{{Cite book | author=Kaiser LR | title=Fishman's Pulmonary Diseases and Disorders | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2008 | pages=1853–1854 | edition=4th | isbn=0-07-145739-9 }}</ref> [[Blood test]]s and [[pulmonary function testing]] are used to assess whether a person is well enough for surgery.<ref name="Collins" /> If pulmonary function tests reveal poor respiratory reserve, surgery may not be possible.<ref name="Harrison" />

In most cases of early-stage NSCLC, removal of a lobe of lung ([[lobectomy]]) is the surgical treatment of choice. In people who are unfit for a full lobectomy, a smaller sublobar excision ([[wedge resection]]) may be performed. However, wedge resection has a higher risk of recurrence than lobectomy.<ref name="Fishman1855">{{Cite book | author=Kaiser LR | title=Fishman's Pulmonary Diseases and Disorders | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2008 | pages=1855–1856 | edition=4th | isbn=0-07-145739-9 }}</ref> Radioactive [[iodine]] [[brachytherapy]] at the margins of wedge excision may reduce the risk of recurrence.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Odell | first=DD |author2=Kent MS |author3=Fernando HC  | title=Sublobar resection with brachytherapy mesh for stage I non-small cell lung cancer | journal=Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery | volume=22 | issue=1 | pages=32–37 |date=Spring 2010 | pmid=20813314 | doi=10.1053/j.semtcvs.2010.04.003}}</ref> Rarely, removal of a whole lung ([[pneumonectomy]]) is performed.<ref name="Fishman1855" /> [[Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery]] (VATS) and [[VATS lobectomy]] use a minimally invasive approach to lung cancer surgery.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Alam | first=N |author2=Flores RM  | title=Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lobectomy: the evidence base | journal=Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons | volume=11 | issue=3 | pages=368–374 |date=July–September 2007 | pmid=17931521 | pmc=3015831}}</ref> VATS lobectomy is equally effective compared to conventional open lobectomy, with less postoperative illness.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Rueth | first=NM |author2=Andrade RS  | title=Is VATS lobectomy better: perioperatively, biologically and oncologically? | journal=Annals of Thoracic Surgery | volume=89 | issue=6 | pages=S2107–S2111 |date=June 2010 | pmid=20493991 | doi=10.1016/j.athoracsur.2010.03.020}}</ref>

===Radiotherapy===
[[Radiation therapy|Radiotherapy]] is often given together with chemotherapy, and may be used with curative intent in people with NSCLC who are not eligible for surgery. This form of high-intensity radiotherapy is called radical radiotherapy.<ref name="OTO" /> A refinement of this technique is continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART), in which a high dose of radiotherapy is given in a short time period.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Hatton | first=MQ |author2=Martin JE | title=Continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART) and non-conventionally fractionated radiotherapy in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer: a review and consideration of future directions | journal=Clinical Oncology (Royal College of Radiologists) | volume=22 | issue=5 | pages=356–364 |date=June 2010 | pmid=20399629 | doi=10.1016/j.clon.2010.03.010}}</ref> Postoperative thoracic radiotherapy generally should not be used after curative intent surgery for NSCLC.<ref name="PORT Meta-analysis Trialists Group" /> Some people with mediastinal N2 lymph node involvement might benefit from post-operative radiotherapy.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Le Péchoux | first=C | title=Role of postoperative radiotherapy in resected non-small cell lung cancer: a reassessment based on new data | journal=Oncologist | volume=16 | issue=5 | pages=672–681 | year=2011 | pmid=21378080 | doi=10.1634/theoncologist.2010-0150 | pmc=3228187}}</ref>

For potentially curable SCLC cases, chest radiotherapy is often recommended in addition to chemotherapy.<ref name="Holland-Frei78" />

[[File:Diagram showing how you have internal radiotherapy for lung cancer CRUK 160.svg|thumb|left|Internal radiotherapy for lung cancer given via the airway.]]
If cancer growth blocks a short section of bronchus, [[brachytherapy]] (localized radiotherapy) may be given directly inside the airway to open the passage. Compared to external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy allows a reduction in treatment time and reduced radiation exposure to healthcare staff.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Ikushima | first=H | title=Radiation therapy: state of the art and the future | journal=Journal of Medical Investigation | volume=57 | issue=1–2 | pages=1–11 |date=February 2010 | url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jmi/57/1,2/1/_pdf | pmid=20299738 | doi=10.2152/jmi.57.1}}</ref> Evidence for brachytherapy, however, is less than that for external beam radiotherapy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Reveiz|first1=L|last2=Rueda|first2=JR|last3=Cardona|first3=AF| title=Palliative endobronchial brachytherapy for non-small cell lung cancer |journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=12 December 2012|volume=12|pages=CD004284|pmid=23235606|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004284.pub3}}</ref>

[[Prophylactic cranial irradiation]] (PCI) is a type of radiotherapy to the brain, used to reduce the risk of [[metastasis]]. PCI is most useful in SCLC. In limited-stage disease, PCI increases three-year survival from 15% to 20%; in extensive disease, one-year survival increases from 13% to 27%.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Paumier | first=A |author2=Cuenca X |author3=Le Péchoux C  | title=Prophylactic cranial irradiation in lung cancer | journal=Cancer Treatment Reviews | volume=37 | issue=4 | pages=261–265 |date=June 2011 | pmid=20934256 | doi=10.1016/j.ctrv.2010.08.009}}</ref>

Recent improvements in targeting and imaging have led to the development of stereotactic radiation in the treatment of early-stage lung cancer. In this form of radiotherapy, high doses are delivered over a number of sessions using stereotactic targeting techniques. Its use is primarily in patients who are not surgical candidates due to medical [[comorbidities]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Girard | first=N |author2=Mornex F | title=Stereotactic radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer: From concept to clinical reality. 2011 update | journal=Cancer Radiothérapie | volume=15 | issue=6–7 | pages=522–526 |date=October 2011 | pmid=21889901 | doi=10.1016/j.canrad.2011.07.241}}</ref>

For both NSCLC and SCLC patients, smaller doses of radiation to the chest may be used for symptom control ([[palliative care|palliative]] radiotherapy).<ref>{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Fairchild A, Harris K, Barnes E, etal | title=Palliative thoracic radiotherapy for lung cancer: a systematic review | journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume=26 | issue=24 | pages=4001–4011 |date=August 2008 | pmid=18711191 | url=http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/26/24/4001.full | doi=10.1200/JCO.2007.15.3312}}</ref>

===Chemotherapy===
The [[chemotherapy]] regimen depends on the tumor type.<ref name="Holland-Frei78" /> Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), even relatively early stage disease, is treated primarily with chemotherapy and radiation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hann CL, Rudin CM |title=Management of small-cell lung cancer: incremental changes but hope for the future |journal=Oncology (Williston Park)|date=30 November 2008|volume=22|issue=13|pages=1486–92 |pmid=19133604}}</ref> In SCLC, [[cisplatin]] and [[etoposide]] are most commonly used.<ref name="Murray"/> Combinations with [[carboplatin]], [[gemcitabine]], [[paclitaxel]], [[vinorelbine]], [[topotecan]], and [[irinotecan]] are also used.<ref name="Azim" /><ref name="MacCallum" /> In advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), chemotherapy improves survival and is used as first-line treatment, provided the person is well enough for the treatment.<ref name="pmid18678835" /> Typically, two drugs are used, of which one is often platinum-based (either [[cisplatin]] or [[carboplatin]]).

[[Adjuvant chemotherapy]] refers to the use of chemotherapy after apparently curative surgery to improve the outcome.

====Targeted therapy====

Several drugs that [[targeted therapy of lung cancer|target molecular pathways]] in lung cancer are available, especially for the treatment of advanced disease. [[Erlotinib]], [[gefitinib]] and [[afatinib]] inhibit [[tyrosine kinase]] at the [[epidermal growth factor receptor]]. [[Denosumab]] is a [[monoclonal antibody]] directed against [[RANKL|receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand]].

Worldwide, lung cancer is the most common cancer among men in terms of both [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] and mortality, and among women has the third highest incidence, and is second after [[breast cancer]] in mortality. In 2012, there were 1.82 million new cases globally, and 1.56 million deaths due to lung cancer, representing 19.4% of all deaths from cancer.<ref name=WCR2014Epi/> The highest rates are in North America, Europe and East Asia, with over a third of new cases in 2012 in China.  Rates in Africa and South Asia are much lower.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stewart|first1=edited by Bernard W.|last2=Wild|first2=Christopher P.|title=World cancer report 2014|date=2014|publisher=IARC Press|location=Lyon|isbn=9789283204299|pages=350–352}}</ref>

The population segment most likely to develop lung cancer is people aged over 50 who have a history of smoking. In contrast to the mortality rate in men, which began declining more than 20 years ago, women's lung cancer mortality rates have been rising over the last decades, and are just recently beginning to stabilize.<ref name="AUTOREF22" /><!-- now declining in US & Aus, WCR --> In the USA, the [[lifetime risk]] of developing lung cancer is 8% in men and 6% in women.<ref name="Harrison" />

Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in the UK (around 43,500 people were diagnosed with the disease in 2011), and it is the most common cause of cancer death (around 35,400 people died in 2012).<ref>{{cite web|title=Lung cancer statistics|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerstats/types/lung/|website=Cancer Research UK|accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref>

From the 1960s, the rates of lung adenocarcinoma started to rise relative to other types of lung cancer. This is partly due to the introduction of filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing deposition in larger airways. However, the smoker has to inhale more deeply to receive the same amount of nicotine, increasing particle deposition in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends to arise.<ref name="Charloux" /> The incidence of lung adenocarcinoma continues to rise.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Kadara | first=H |author2=Kabbout M |author3=Wistuba II  | title=Pulmonary adenocarcinoma: a renewed entity in 2011 | journal=Respirology | volume=17 | issue=1 | pages=50–65 |date=January 2012 | pmid=22040022 | doi=10.1111/j.1440-1843.2011.02095.x }}</ref>

==History==
Lung cancer was uncommon before the advent of cigarette smoking; it was not even recognized as a distinct disease until 1761.<ref name="AUTOREF27" /> Different aspects of lung cancer were described further in 1810.<ref name="AUTOREF28" /> Malignant lung tumors made up only 1% of all cancers seen at autopsy in 1878, but had risen to 10–15% by the early 1900s.<ref name="Witschi" /> Case reports in the medical literature numbered only 374 worldwide in 1912,<ref name="AUTOREF29" /> but a review of autopsies showed the incidence of lung cancer had increased from 0.3% in 1852 to 5.66% in 1952.<ref name="Grannis" /> In [[Germany]] in 1929, physician [[Fritz Lickint]] recognized the link between smoking and lung cancer,<ref name="Witschi" /> which led to an aggressive [[Anti-tobacco movement in Nazi Germany|antismoking campaign]].<ref name="Proctor" /> The [[British Doctors Study|British Doctors' Study]], published in the 1950s, was the first solid [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] evidence of the link between lung cancer and smoking.<ref name="Doll" /> As a result, in 1964 the [[Surgeon General of the United States]] recommended smokers should stop smoking.<ref name="AUTOREF30" />

The connection with [[radon]] gas was first recognized among miners in the [[Ore Mountains (Germany)|Ore Mountains]] near [[Schneeberg, Saxony]]. [[Silver]] has been mined there since 1470, and these mines are rich in [[uranium]], with its accompanying [[radium]] and radon gas.<ref name="Greaves" /> Miners developed a disproportionate amount of lung disease, eventually recognized as lung cancer in the 1870s.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Greenberg | first=M |author2=Selikoff IJ  | title=Lung cancer in the Schneeberg mines: a reappraisal of the data reported by Harting and Hesse in 1879 | journal=Annals of Occupational Hygiene | volume=37 | issue=1 | pages=5–14 |date=February 1993 | pmid=8460878 | doi=10.1093/annhyg/37.1.5}}</ref> Despite this discovery, mining continued into the 1950s, due to the [[USSR]]'s demand for uranium.<ref name="Greaves" /> Radon was confirmed as a cause of lung cancer in the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Samet | first=JM | title=Radiation and cancer risk: a continuing challenge for epidemiologists | journal=Environmental Health | volume=10 | issue=Suppl. 1 | pages=S4 |date=April 2011 | pmid=21489214 | doi=10.1186/1476-069X-10-S1-S4 | pmc=3073196}}</ref>

The first successful [[pneumonectomy]] for lung cancer was performed in 1933.<ref name="AUTOREF32" /> Palliative [[radiotherapy]] has been used since the 1940s.<ref name="Edwards" /> Radical radiotherapy, initially used in the 1950s, was an attempt to use larger radiation doses in patients with relatively early-stage lung cancer, but who were otherwise unfit for surgery.<ref name="AUTOREF33" /> In 1997, continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy was seen as an improvement over conventional radical radiotherapy.<ref name="Saunders" /> With small-cell lung carcinoma, initial attempts in the 1960s at surgical resection<ref name="AUTOREF34" /> and radical radiotherapy<ref name="AUTOREF35" /> were unsuccessful. In the 1970s, successful chemotherapy regimens were developed.<ref name="AUTOREF36" />

==Research directions==
Current research directions for lung cancer treatment include [[immunotherapy]],<ref name="Brahmer" >{{cite journal|last1=Brahmer|first1=JR|title=Immune checkpoint blockade: the hope for immunotherapy as a treatment of lung cancer?|journal=Seminars in oncology|date=February 2014|volume=41|issue=1|pages=126–32|pmid=24565586|doi=10.1053/j.seminoncol.2013.12.014}}</ref> which encourages the body's immune system to attack the tumor cells, [[epigenetics]], and new combinations of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, both on their own and together.  Many of these new treatments work through [[immune checkpoint blockade]], disrupting cancer's ability to evade the [[immune system]].<ref name="Brahmer" />

[[Ipilimumab]] blocks [[Signal transduction|signaling]] through a [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] on [[T cells]] known as [[CTLA-4]] which dampens down the immune system. It has been approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for treatment of [[melanoma]] and is undergoing clinical trials for both non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC).<ref name="Brahmer" />

Other immunotherapy treatments interfere with the binding of [[programmed cell death 1]] (PD-1) protein with its [[ligand]] [[programmed cell death 1 ligand 1|PD-1 ligand 1]] (PD-L1). Signaling through PD-1 inactivates T cells. Some cancer cells appear to exploit this by expressing PD-L1 in order to switch off T cells that might recognise them as a threat. Monoclonal antibodies targeting both PD-1 and PD-L1, such as [[pembrolizumab]] and [[nivolumab]]<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Powell | first1=CA | last2=Halmos | first2=B | last3=Nana-Sinkam | first3=SP | title=Update in lung cancer and mesothelioma 2012 |date=July 2013 | journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine | volume=188 | issue=2 | pages=157–166 | pmid=23855692 | doi=10.1164/rccm.201304-0716UP | pmc=3778761 }}</ref> are currently in clinical trials for treatment for lung cancer.<ref name="Brahmer" />

[[Epigenetics]] is the study of small, usually heritable, molecular modifications&mdash;or "tags"&mdash;that bind DNA and modify [[gene expression]] levels. Targeting these tags with drugs can kill cancer cells. Early-stage research in NSCLC using drugs aimed at epigenetic modifications shows that blocking more than one of these tags can kill cancer cells with fewer side effects.<ref name="Epi" >{{cite journal|last1=Forde|first1=PM|last2=Brahmer|first2=JR|last3=Kelly|first3=RJ|title=New strategies in lung cancer: epigenetic therapy for non-small cell lung cancer.|journal=Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research|date=1 May 2014|volume=20|issue=9|pages=2244–8|pmid=24644000|doi=10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-13-2088}}</ref> Studies also show that giving patients these drugs before standard treatment can improve its effectiveness. Clinical trials are underway to evaluate how well these drugs kill lung cancer cells in humans.<ref name="Epi" /> Several drugs that target epigenetic mechanisms are in development. [[Histone deacetylase inhibitor]]s in development include [[valproic acid]], [[vorinostat]], [[belinostat]], [[panobinostat]], [[entinostat]], and [[romidepsin]]. [[DNA methyltransferase]] inhibitors in development include [[decitabine]], [[azacitidine|azacytidine]], and [[hydralazine]].<ref name="Jakopovic" />

The results of this project will help scientists and doctors gain a better understanding of NSCLC and potentially lead to the development of new treatments against the disease.<ref name="Tracer" />

For lung cancer cases that develop resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and [[anaplastic lymphoma kinase]] (ALK) [[Kinase tyrosine-based inhibitory motif|tyrosine kinase inhibitors]], new drugs are in development. New EGFR inhibitors include afatinib and [[dacomitinib]]. An alternative signaling pathway, [[c-Met]], can be inhibited by [[tivantinib]] and [[onartuzumab]].
