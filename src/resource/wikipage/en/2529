'''Alexandra''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc-gre|Ἀλεξάνδρα}}) is the feminine form of the given name [[Alexander]], which is a [[romanization]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] name {{lang|grc-gre|Ἀλέξανδρος}} (''Alexandros''). [[Etymology|Etymologically]], the name is a compound of the Greek verb {{lang|grc|ἀλέξειν}} (''alexein'') "to defend" and {{lang|grc|ἀνήρ}} (''anēr'') "man" (<small>[[genitive|GEN]]</small> {{lang|grc|ἀνδρός}} ''andros''). Thus it may be roughly translated as "defender of man" or "protector of man".<ref>{{LSJ|a)le/candros|Ἀλέξανδρος|ref}}</ref><ref>{{LSJ|a)le/cw|ἀλέξειν|shortref}}</ref><ref>{{LSJ|a)nh/r|ἀνήρ|shortref}}.</ref> The name was one of the titles or [[epithet]]s given to the Greek goddess [[Hera]] and as such is usually taken to mean "one who comes to save warriors". The earliest attested form of the name is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] {{lang|gmy|𐀀𐀩𐀏𐀭𐀅𐀨}}, ''a-re-ka-sa-da-ra'', written in the [[Linear B]] syllabic script.<ref>Tablet [[Mycenae|MY]] V 659 (61). {{cite web|url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&wid=217|title=The Linear B word a-re-ka-sa-da-ra|website=Palaeolexicon.
