In response to the growing protest movement, the military leaders of the [[coup]] enacted a number of countermeasures. These include [[Internet outage#Government blackout|internet and social media blackouts]], a [[media blackout]], pursuit of arrests and criminal sentences against protesters, the spread of disinformation, political overtures to competing political parties to participate in the self-appointed [[State Administration Council]] (to replace the elected government body), deployment of pro-military protesters and instigators, and the violent use of force to suppress protests.

== Background ==
The [[2021 Myanmar coup d'état]] began on the morning of 1{{nbs}}February 2021 when [[Elections in Myanmar|democratically elected]] members of [[Myanmar]]'s [[ruling party]], the [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD), were deposed by the [[Tatmadaw]]{{snd}}[[Military of Myanmar|Myanmar's military]]{{snd}}which vested power in a [[stratocracy]], the [[State Administration Council]]. The Tatmadaw declared a year-long [[state of emergency]] and declared power had been vested in [[Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services]] [[Min Aung Hlaing]]. The [[coup d'état]] occurred the day before the [[Assembly of the Union|Parliament of Myanmar]] was due to swear in the members elected at the [[2020 Myanmar general election|November 2020 general election]], thereby preventing this from occurring.<ref>{{cite web|date=1 February 2021|title=Myanmar military seizes power, detains elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi|url=https://news.trust.org/item/20210201014444-5u7cm|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210201053645/https://news.trust.org/item/20210201014444-5u7cm|archive-date=1 February 2021|access-date=1 February 2021|website=Thomson Reuters Foundation News|agency=Reuters}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=1 February 2021|title=Myanmar gov't declares 1-year state of emergency: President's Office|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-02/01/c_139712581.htm|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210201102057/http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-02/01/c_139712581.htm|archive-date=1 February 2021|access-date=1 February 2021|agency=Xinhua News Agency}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Myanmar Leader Aung San Suu Kyi, Others Detained by Military|url=https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/myanmar-leader-aung-san-suu-kyi-others-detained-military|date=1 February 2021 |website=voanews.com|publisher=VOA (Voice of America)|access-date=1 February 2021|archive-date=3 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210203131316/https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/myanmar-leader-aung-san-suu-kyi-others-detained-military|url-status=live}}</ref> [[President of Myanmar|President]] [[Win Myint]] and [[State Counsellor of Myanmar|State Counsellor]] [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] were detained, along with [[Cabinet of Myanmar|ministers and their deputies]] and members of Parliament.<ref name=":0">{{cite news|last=Beech|first=Hannah|date=31 January 2021|title=Myanmar's Leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Is Detained Amid Coup|newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/31/world/asia/myanmar-coup-suu-kyi.html|access-date=31 January 2021|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=31 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210131235036/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/31/world/asia/myanmar-coup-suu-kyi.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Mahtani|first1=Shibani |author2=Kyaw Ye Lynn|title=Myanmar military seizes power in coup after detaining Aung San Suu Kyi|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/myanmar-aung-sun-suu-kyi-arrest/2021/01/31/c780ce6a-6419-11eb-886d-5264d4ceb46d_story.html|date=1 February 2021|access-date=1 February 2021|newspaper=The Washington Post|archive-date=1 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210201182106/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/myanmar-aung-sun-suu-kyi-arrest/2021/01/31/c780ce6a-6419-11eb-886d-5264d4ceb46d_story.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Spread of misinformation ====
Unsubstantiated rumours of Suu Kyi's release had circulated, which was falsely attributed to and denied by [[Radio Free Asia]]; this rumour is reported to have been shared by the military-run [[Myawaddy TV]], and triggered street celebrations and fireworks.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Tun|first=Aung Hla|date=12 November 2010|title=Rumors swirl in Myanmar over Suu Kyi release|language=en|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-suukyi-idUSTRE6AB1P120101112|access-date=29 March 2021|archive-date=23 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210523052132/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-suukyi-idUSTRE6AB1P120101112|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Myanmar coup: Tens of thousands protest and call for Aung San Suu Kyi's release despite internet being cut off|url=https://news.sky.com/story/myanmar-coup-tens-of-thousands-protest-and-call-for-aung-san-suu-kyis-release-despite-internet-being-cut-off-12211146|access-date=7 February 2021|website=Sky News}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=ဒေါ်အောင်ဆန်းစုကြည် လွတ်ပြီဆိုသည့်သတင်းမှား ပျံ့နှံ့နေ|url=https://www.rfa.org/burmese/news/dassk-release-rumor-02062021113852.html|access-date=29 March 2021|website=Radio Free Asia|language=en}}</ref> An imposter website mimicking Radio Free Asia was set up, posting false articles "about COVID-19, the Muslim [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] community, as well as slurs against leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her ruling National League for Democracy".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Myanmar News Site Mimics RFA to Spread Disinformation Before Elections|url=https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/media-fake-10132020104123.html|access-date=29 March 2021|website=Radio Free Asia|language=en|archive-date=30 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210330142258/https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/media-fake-10132020104123.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

To counter the spread of misinformation, in February [[Facebook]] issued a blanket ban on all pages relating to Myanmar's military, as well as state media network Myanmar Radio and Television (MRTV).
