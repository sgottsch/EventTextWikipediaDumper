'''Ronald Wilson Reagan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɒ|n|əl|d|_|ˈ|w|ɪ|l|s|ən|_|ˈ|r|eɪ|ɡ|ən}}; February 6, 1911&nbsp;– June 5, 2004) was an American politician and actor who was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|40th]] [[President of the United States]], from 1981 to 1989. Before his presidency, he was the 33rd [[Governor of California]], from 1967 to 1975, after a career as a [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]] actor and union leader.

Raised in a poor family in small towns of northern Illinois, Reagan graduated from [[Eureka College]] in 1932 and worked as a sports announcer on several regional radio stations. After moving to Hollywood in 1937, he became an actor and starred in a few major productions. Reagan was twice elected President of the [[Screen Actors Guild]], the labor union for actors, where he worked to root out [[House Un-American Activities Committee|Communist influence]]. In the 1950s, he moved into television and was a motivational speaker at [[General Electric]] factories. Having been a lifelong [[Democratic Party (United States)#Liberals|Democrat]], his views changed. He became a conservative and in 1962 switched to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. In [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]], Reagan's speech, "[[A Time for Choosing]]", in support of [[Barry Goldwater]]'s foundering presidential campaign, earned him national attention as a new conservative spokesman. Building a network of supporters, he was [[California gubernatorial election, 1966|elected Governor of California]] in 1966. As governor, Reagan raised taxes, turned a state budget deficit to a surplus, challenged the protesters at the [[University of California]], ordered [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] troops in during a period of [[People's Park (Berkeley)|protest movements]] in 1969, and was [[California gubernatorial election, 1970|re-elected in 1970]]. He twice ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for the U.S. presidency in [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]] and [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]]; four years later, he easily won the nomination outright, becoming the oldest elected U.S. president up to that time, defeating incumbent [[Jimmy Carter]] in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]].

Entering the presidency in [[First inauguration of Ronald Reagan|1981]], Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives. His [[Supply-side economics|supply-side economic]] policies, dubbed "[[Reaganomics]]", advocated tax rate reduction to spur economic growth, control of the money supply to curb inflation, economic deregulation, and reduction in government spending. In his first term he survived an [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|assassination attempt]], spurred the [[War on Drugs]], and fought public sector labor. Over his two terms, the economy saw a reduction of inflation from 12.5% to 4.4%, and an average annual growth of [[Gross domestic product|real GDP]] of 3.4; while Reagan did enact cuts in domestic discretionary spending, tax cuts and increased military spending contributed to increased federal outlays overall, even after adjustment for inflation. During his re-election bid, Reagan campaigned on the notion that it was "[[Morning in America]]", winning a [[United States presidential election, 1984|landslide in 1984]] with the largest electoral college victory in American history. Foreign affairs dominated his second term, including ending of the [[Cold War]], the [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|bombing of Libya]], and the [[Iran–Contra affair]]. Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an "[[evil empire]]", and during his famous speech at the [[Brandenburg Gate]], President Reagan challenged Gorbachev to "[[tear down this wall!]]". He transitioned Cold War policy from [[détente]] to [[rollback]], by escalating an [[arms race]] with the USSR while engaging in talks with Soviet [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], which culminated in the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty|INF Treaty]], shrinking both countries' nuclear arsenals.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gingrich, Newt|authorlink=Newt Gingrich|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/evil-empire|title=The Evil Empire|work=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]|date=Spring–Summer 2008|volume=58|issue=4|accessdate=July 22, 2010}}</ref> Reagan's presidency came during the decline of the Soviet Union and just ten months after the end of his term, the [[Berlin Wall]] fell, and on December 26, 1991, nearly three years after he left office, the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union collapsed]].

Leaving office in 1989, Reagan held an approval rating of sixty-eight percent, matching those of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and later [[Bill Clinton]], as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era.<ref>{{cite web|title = A Look Back At The Polls|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-look-back-at-the-polls/|publisher = CBS News|accessdate = May 15, 2015}}</ref> He was the first president since [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to serve two full terms, after a succession of five prior presidents failed to do so, although, Richard Nixon was elected twice, he was caught up in scandal, which led to his resignation. While having planned an active post-presidency, in 1994 Reagan disclosed his diagnosis with [[Alzheimer's disease]] earlier that year, appearing publicly for the last time at the [[Death and funeral of Richard Nixon|funeral of Richard Nixon]]; he [[Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan|died ten years later]] in 2004 at the age of 93. An icon among Republicans, he is viewed favorably in [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|historian rankings of U.S. presidents]], and his tenure constituted a [[Realigning election|realignment]] toward [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] policies in the U.S.

==Early life==
Ronald Wilson Reagan was born in an apartment on the [[Birthplace of Ronald Reagan|second floor of a commercial building]] in [[Tampico, Illinois]] on February 6, 1911. He was the younger son of [[Nelle Wilson Reagan|Nelle Clyde]] ({{nee|Wilson}}) and [[Jack Reagan|John Edward "Jack" Reagan]].<ref name=nrhp /> Jack was a salesman and storyteller whose grandparents were [[Irish Catholic]] immigrants from [[County Tipperary]],<ref>[[Terry Golway]], ''Ronald Reagan's America'' (2008) p. 1</ref> while Nelle was of half-[[English people|English]] and half-[[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent (her mother was born in [[Surrey]]).<ref>Kengor, p. 4</ref> Reagan's older brother, [[Neil Reagan|John Neil Reagan]] (1908–1996), became an advertising executive.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Neil Reagan, 88, Ad Executive And Jovial Brother of President|author=Lynette Holloway|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/13/us/neil-reagan-88-ad-executive-and-jovial-brother-of-president.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 13, 1996|accessdate=March 22, 2009}}</ref> As a boy, Reagan's father nicknamed his son "Dutch", due to his "[[Dutch Boy Paint|fat little Dutchman]]"-like appearance and "Dutchboy" haircut;<ref name="RRfacts">{{cite web|url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/reference/facts.html|title=Ronald Reagan Facts|accessdate=June 9, 2007|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation}}</ref> the nickname stuck with him throughout his youth.<ref name="RRfacts" /> Reagan's family briefly lived in several towns and cities in Illinois, including [[Monmouth, Illinois|Monmouth]], [[Galesburg, Illinois|Galesburg]], and Chicago.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/3637552-418/reagan-university-president-park-building.html|title=Is Ronald Reagan's Chicago boyhood home doomed?|work=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=June 12, 2012|last=Janssen|first=Kim|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202005705/http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/3637552-418/reagan-university-president-park-building.html|archivedate=December 2, 2011}}</ref> In 1919, they returned to Tampico and lived above the [[H.

According to [[Paul Kengor]], author of ''God and Ronald Reagan'', Reagan had a particularly strong faith in the goodness of people, which stemmed from the optimistic faith of his mother<ref name="pk 16">Kengor, p. 16</ref> and the [[Disciples of Christ]] faith,<ref name="pk 16" /> into which he was baptized in 1922.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Lewis|editor-first1=Warren|editor-last2=Rollmann|editor-first2=Hans|title=Restoring the First-century Church in the Twenty-first Century|publisher=Wipf and Stock|year=2005|isbn=1-59752-416-6|pages=181–192}}</ref> For the time, Reagan was unusual in his opposition to [[racial discrimination]], and recalled a time in Dixon when the local inn would not allow [[African Americans|black people]] to stay there. Reagan brought them back to his house, where his mother invited them to stay the night and have breakfast the next morning.<ref>Kengor, p. 15</ref> After the closure of the Pitney Store in late 1920 and the family's move to Dixon,<ref>Cannon (2001), p. 2</ref> the midwestern "small universe" had a lasting impression on Reagan.<ref>Reagan (1990), p. 27</ref>

===Education===

Over a six-year period, Reagan reportedly performed 77 rescues as a lifeguard.<ref>Brands, ''Reagan'' (2015) pp.&nbsp;16–7</ref> He attended [[Eureka College]], a Disciples-oriented liberal arts school, where he became a member of the [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity, a cheerleader, and studied economics and sociology. While involved, the [[Miller Center of Public Affairs]] described him as an "indifferent student". He majored in economics and sociology, and graduated with a C grade.<ref name=majoraverage>{{cite news|title=Ronald Reagan: Life Before the Presidency|url=http://millercenter.org/president/biography/reagan-life-before-the-presidency|accessdate=August 30, 2015|publisher=Miller Center}}</ref> He developed a reputation as a "jack of all trades", excelling in campus politics, sports, and theater. He was a member of the [[American football|football]] team and captain of the swim team.

===Radio and film===
[[File:Ronald Reagan in The Bad Man (1941).png|thumb|left|upright=0.75|''[[The Bad Man (1941 film)|The Bad Man]]'' (1941)]]
After graduating from Eureka in 1932, Reagan drove himself to Iowa, where he held jobs as an announcer at several stations. He moved to [[WHO (AM)|WHO]] radio in [[Des Moines]] as an announcer for [[Chicago Cubs]] baseball games. His specialty was creating play-by-play accounts of games using as his source only basic descriptions that the station received by wire as the games were in progress.<ref>Brands, ''Reagan'' (2015) pp.&nbsp;24–31</ref>

While traveling with the Cubs in California, Reagan took a screen test in 1937 that led to a seven-year contract with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] studios.<ref>Brands, ''Reagan'' (2015) pp.&nbsp;35–41</ref> He spent the first few years of his Hollywood career in the "[[B movie|B film]]" unit, where, Reagan joked, the producers "didn't want them good; they wanted them Thursday".<ref name="agpi" />

His first screen credit was the starring role in the 1937 movie ''[[Love Is on the Air]]'', and by the end of 1939 he had already appeared in 19 films,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/biography/hollywood_years.asp|title=Ronald Reagan > Hollywood Years|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation|accessdate=March 28, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312120428/http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/biography/hollywood_years.asp|archivedate=March 12, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> including ''[[Dark Victory]]'' with [[Bette Davis]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]]. Before the film ''[[Santa Fe Trail (film)|Santa Fe Trail]]'' with [[Errol Flynn]] in 1940, he played the role of [[George Gipp|George "The Gipper" Gipp]] in the film ''[[Knute Rockne, All American]]''; from it, he acquired the lifelong nickname "the Gipper."<ref name="Cannon15">Cannon (2001), p. 15</ref> In 1941, exhibitors voted him the fifth most popular star from the younger generation in Hollywood.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article8208562|title=CUPID'S INFLUENCE ON THE FILM BOX-OFFICE.|newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848–1956)]]|location=Melbourne, Vic.|date=October 4, 1941|accessdate=April 24, 2012|page=7 Supplement: The Argus Week-end Magazine|publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

Reagan's favorite acting role was as a double amputee in 1942's ''[[Kings Row]]'',<ref name="Rest of Me">{{Cite book|last=Reagan|first=Ronald|title=Where's the Rest of Me?|year=1965|publisher=Duell, Sloan, and Pearce|location=New York|isbn=0-283-98771-5}}</ref> in which he recites the line "Where's the rest of me?"—later used as the title of his 1965 autobiography.

Reagan never left the United States during the war, though he kept a film reel, obtained while in the service, depicting the liberation of the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], as he believed that someday doubts would arise as to whether [[the Holocaust]] had occurred.<ref name="cannon486-90">Cannon, Lou (1991), pp.&nbsp;486–490</ref> It has been alleged that he was overheard telling Israeli foreign minister [[Yitzhak Shamir]] in 1983 that he had filmed that footage himself and helped liberate Auschwitz,<ref name="cannon486-90" /><ref>Schaller, M., ''Reckoning with Reagan'', New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 1992, p. 9</ref> though this purported conversation was disputed by Secretary of State [[George P.

===Television===
Though an early critic of television, Reagan landed fewer film roles in the late 1950s and decided to join the medium.<ref name="agpi" /> He was hired as the host of ''[[General Electric Theater]]'', a series of weekly dramas that became very popular.<ref name="agpi" /> His contract required him to tour [[General Electric]] (GE) plants 16 weeks out of the year, often demanding of him 14 speeches per day.<ref name="agpi" /> He earned approximately $125,000 per year (about $1.07&nbsp;million in 2010 dollars) in this role. The show ran for 10 seasons from 1953 to 1962, which increased Reagan's profile in American households.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe|title=Morning Joe on MSNBC}}</ref> Previously, he had appeared in feature films mostly in supporting role or as a "second lead".

His final work as a professional actor was as host and performer from 1964 to 1965 on the television series ''[[Death Valley Days]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/death-valley-days/cast/200859 |title=Death Valley Days |publisher= CBS Interactive Inc. |accessdate=August 25, 2013}}</ref>

==Early political career==
[[File:Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan aboard a boat in California 1964.jpg|thumb|Ronald and Nancy Reagan aboard a boat in California, 1964]]
Reagan began as a Hollywood [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democrat]], and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was "a true hero" to him.<ref>{{cite book|author=Edward M. Yager|title=Ronald Reagan's Journey: Democrat to Republican|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U2cs7IHERBwC&pg=PA12|year=2006|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|pages=12–15}}</ref> He moved to the right in the 1950s, became a Republican in 1962, and emerged as a leading conservative spokesman in the [[Barry Goldwater presidential campaign, 1964|Goldwater campaign of 1964]].<ref>Lori Clune, "Political Ideology and Activism to 1966" in Andrew L. Johns, ed., ''A Companion to Ronald Reagan'' (2015) pp.&nbsp;22–39.</ref>

In his early political career, he joined numerous political committees with a left-wing orientation, such as the [[American Veterans Committee (1943–2008)|American Veterans Committee]]. He fought against Republican-sponsored right-to-work legislation and supported [[Helen Gahagan Douglas]] in 1950 when she [[United States Senate election in California, 1950|was defeated for the Senate]] by [[Richard Nixon]]. It was his realization that [[Communism|Communists]] were a powerful backstage influence in those groups that led him to rally his friends against them.<ref>{{cite book|author=J.

Reagan spoke frequently at rallies with a strong ideological dimension; in December 1945, he was stopped from leading an anti-nuclear rally in Hollywood by pressure from the [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros]]. studio. He would later make nuclear weapons a key point of his presidency, specifically his opposition to [[mutual assured destruction]], and he built on previous efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/lecture/president-reagans-legacy-and-us-nuclear-weapons-policy |title=President Reagan's Legacy and U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy. |publisher=Heritage.org |date=July 20, 2006 |accessdate=April 14, 2014}}</ref> In the [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948 presidential election]], Reagan strongly supported [[Harry S.

Eisenhower]] in 1952 and 1956 as well as Richard Nixon in 1960.<ref>Pemberton (1998) pp.&nbsp;29–31</ref>

He was hired by [[General Electric]] (GE) in 1954 to host the ''[[General Electric Theater]]'', a weekly TV drama series. He also traveled across the country to give talks to over 200,000 GE employees as a motivational speaker. His many speeches—which he wrote himself—were [[Nonpartisanism|non-partisan]] but carried a conservative, pro-business message; he was influenced by [[Lemuel Boulware]], a senior GE executive. Boulware, known for his tough stance against unions and his innovative strategies to win over workers, championed the core tenets of modern American conservatism: [[free markets]], [[Anti-communism|anticommunism]], lower taxes, and [[limited government]].<ref>Thomas W. Evans, ''The Education of Ronald Reagan: The General Electric Years and the Untold Story of His Conversion to Conservatism'' (2008).</ref> Eager for a larger stage, but not allowed to enter politics by GE, he quit and formally registered as a Republican.<ref>Brands, ''Reagan'' (2015) p. 128</ref> He often said, "I didn't leave the Democratic Party. The party left me."<ref>Hayward, p. 635.</ref>

When the legislation that would become [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] was introduced in 1961, he created a recording for the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) warning that such legislation would mean the end of freedom in America. Reagan said that if his listeners did not write letters to prevent it, "we will awake to find that we have [[socialism]]. And if you don't do this, and if I don't do it, one of these days, you and I are going to spend our sunset years telling our children, and our children's children, what it once was like in America when men were free."<ref>{{YouTube|id=AYrlDlrLDSQ|title=Ronald Reagan speaks out on Socialized Medicine&nbsp;– Audio|link=no}}</ref><ref>Richard Rapaport, June 21, 2009, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/06/18/INME187IB0.DTL How AMA 'Coffeecup' gave Reagan a boost].

Reagan gained national attention in his speeches for conservative presidential contender [[Barry Goldwater]] in 1964.<ref>Brands, ''Reagan'' (2015) pp.&nbsp;1–6</ref> Speaking for Goldwater, Reagan stressed his belief in the importance of smaller government. He consolidated themes that he had developed in his talks for GE to deliver his famous speech, "[[A Time for Choosing]]":{{quote|The Founding Fathers knew a government can't control the economy without controlling people. And they knew when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. So we have come to a time for choosing&nbsp;...

Shortly after the beginning of his term, Reagan tested the [[United States presidential election, 1968|presidential waters in 1968]] as part of a "Stop Nixon" movement, hoping to cut into Nixon's southern support<ref name="Stormy">*{{cite book|author=Fischer, Klaus|title=America in White, Black, and Gray: The Stormy 1960s|year=2006|publisher=Continuum|isbn=0-8264-1816-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sCXig_6abwkC&pg=PA241 |pages=241–243}}</ref> and become a compromise candidate<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899963,00.html|title=The New Rules of Play|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=March 8, 1968|accessdate=October 16, 2007}}</ref> if neither Nixon nor second-place candidate [[Nelson Rockefeller]] received enough delegates to win on the first ballot at the [[1968 Republican National Convention|Republican convention]].

Reagan was involved in several high-profile conflicts with the protest movements of the era, including his public criticism of university administrators for tolerating student demonstrations at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] campus. On May 15, 1969, during the [[People's Park (Berkeley)#May 15, 1969: "Bloody Thursday"|People's Park protests]] at the university's campus (the original purpose of which was to discuss the [[Arab–Israeli conflict#1967–73|Arab–Israeli conflict]]), Reagan sent the [[California Highway Patrol]] and other officers to quell the protests.

[[File:NIXONSandREAGANS.jpg|thumb|Meeting with President [[Richard Nixon]] and First Lady [[Pat Nixon]], July 1970]]

Early in 1967, the national debate on abortion was starting to gain traction. In the early stages of the debate, Democratic California state senator [[Anthony C. Beilenson]] introduced the "Therapeutic Abortion Act" in an effort to reduce the number of "back-room abortions" performed in California.<ref name="Cannon50" /> The state legislature sent the bill to Reagan's desk where, after many days of indecision, he signed it on June 14, 1967.<ref name="Cannon51">Cannon (2001), p. 51</ref> About two million abortions would be performed as a result, mostly because of a provision in the bill allowing abortions for the well-being of the mother.<ref name="Cannon51" /> Reagan had been in office for only four months when he signed the bill, and later stated that had he been more experienced as governor, he would not have signed it. After he recognized what he called the "consequences" of the bill, he announced that he was [[pro-life]].<ref name="Cannon51" /> He maintained that position later in his political career, writing extensively about abortion.<ref>Reagan, Ronald.

In 1967, Reagan signed the [[Mulford Act]], which repealed a law allowing [[Open carry in the United States|public carrying]] of loaded firearms (becoming [[California Penal Code]] 12031 and 171(c)).

Unruh]]. He chose not to seek a third term in the following election cycle. One of Reagan's greatest frustrations in office concerned [[capital punishment]], which he strongly supported.<ref name="Rest of Me" /> His efforts to enforce the state's laws in this area were thwarted when the [[Supreme Court of California]] issued its ''[[People v. Anderson]]'' decision, which invalidated all death sentences issued in California before 1972, though the decision was later overturned by a constitutional amendment. The only execution during Reagan's governorship was on April 12, 1967, when [[Aaron Mitchell (murderer)|Aaron Mitchell]]'s sentence was carried out by the state in [[San Quentin]]'s gas chamber.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Seneker, Carl J|title=Governor Reagan and Executive Clemency|journal=California Law Review|volume=55|issue=2|pages=412–418|date=May 1967|doi=10.2307/3479351|jstor=3479351}}</ref>

In 1969, Reagan, as governor, signed the Family Law Act, an amalgam of two bills which had been written and revised by the [[California State Legislature]] for over two years.<ref>Community Property and Family Law: The Family Law Act of 1969 by Aidan R.

Reagan's terms as governor helped to shape the policies he would pursue in his later political career as president. By campaigning on a platform of sending "the welfare bums back to work," he spoke out against the idea of the [[welfare state]]. He also strongly advocated the Republican ideal of less government regulation of the economy, including that of undue federal taxation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/7092/reagan_economic_legacy.html|title=The Reagan Economic Legacy|accessdate=August 22, 2007|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|date=June 9, 2004|author=Kubarych, Roger M}}</ref>

Reagan did not seek re-election to a third term as governor in 1974 and was succeeded by the [[Secretary of State of California|Secretary of State]], Democrat [[Jerry Brown]], on January 6, 1975.

In 1976, Reagan challenged incumbent President [[Gerald Ford]] in a bid to become the Republican Party's candidate for president. Reagan soon established himself as the conservative candidate with the support of like-minded organizations such as the [[American Conservative Union]], which became key components of his political base, while President Ford was considered a more moderate Republican.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/gf38.html|title=Biography of Gerald R.

However, as the [[1976 Republican National Convention|GOP convention]] neared, Ford appeared close to victory.

Reagan's concession speech emphasized the dangers of nuclear war and the threat posed by the Soviet Union.

Reagan launched his campaign by declaring "I believe in states' rights." After receiving the Republican nomination, Reagan selected one of his primary opponents, [[George H. W.

Reagan won the election, carrying 44 states with 489 electoral votes to 49 electoral votes for Carter (representing six states and Washington, D.C.). Reagan received 51% of the popular vote while Carter took 41%, and Independent [[John B.

Reagan's policies proposed that economic growth would occur when marginal tax rates were low enough to spur investment, which would then lead to higher employment and wages.

During Reagan's presidency, a program was initiated within the [[United States Intelligence Community]] to ensure America's economic strength. The program, [[Project Socrates]], developed and demonstrated the means required for the United States to generate and lead the next evolutionary leap in technology acquisition and utilization for a competitive advantage—automated innovation. To ensure that the United States acquired the maximum benefit from automated innovation, Reagan, during his second term, had an executive order drafted to create a new federal agency to implement the Project Socrates results on a nationwide basis. However, Reagan's term came to end before the executive order could be coordinated and signed, and the incoming Bush administration, labeling Project Socrates as "industrial policy," had it terminated.<ref>{{cite news|first =Gene|last =Koprowski|title =Tech Intelligence Revival?

On October 25, 1983, Reagan ordered U.S. forces to invade Grenada (codenamed "Operation Urgent Fury") where a 1979 [[coup d'état]] had established an independent [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] government. A formal appeal from the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS) led to the intervention of U.S. forces; President Reagan also cited an allegedly regional threat posed by a Soviet-Cuban military build-up in the Caribbean and concern for the safety of several hundred American medical students at St.&nbsp;George's University as adequate reasons to invade.

Reagan's opponent in the 1984 presidential election was former Vice President [[Walter Mondale]]. With questions about Reagan's age, and a weak performance in the first presidential debate, his ability to perform the duties of president for another term was questioned. His apparent confused and forgetful behavior was evident to his supporters; they had previously known him clever and witty.

Reagan was sworn in as president for the second time on January 20, 1985, in a private ceremony at the [[White House]]. At 73 years of age, he was the oldest person to ever have been sworn into a second term. Because January 20 fell on a Sunday, a public celebration was not held but took place in the [[Capitol rotunda]] the following day. January 21 was one of the [[Winter 1985 cold wave|coldest days on record]] in Washington, D.C.; due to poor weather, inaugural celebrations were held inside the Capitol. In the coming weeks he shook up his staff somewhat, moving [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[James Baker]] to Secretary of the Treasury and naming Treasury Secretary [[Donald Regan]], a former [[Merrill Lynch]] officer, Chief of Staff.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/05/us/briefing-186924.html|title=Phil Gailey and Warren Weaver Jr., "Briefing"|work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=January 27, 2011|date=June 5, 1982}}</ref><ref name="nytimes.com" />

In 1985, Reagan visited a German military cemetery in [[Bitburg]] to lay a wreath with West German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]]. It was determined that the cemetery held the graves of forty-nine members of the [[Waffen-SS]]. Reagan issued a statement that called the Nazi soldiers buried in that cemetery as themselves "victims," a designation which ignited a stir over whether Reagan had equated the SS men to victims of [[the Holocaust]]; [[Pat Buchanan]], Reagan's Director of Communications, argued that the president did not equate the SS members with the actual Holocaust.<ref>{{cite web|author=Buchanan, Pat|authorlink =Pat Buchanan|url=http://www.buchanan.org/pma-99-1105-wallstjl.html|title=Pat Buchanan's Response to Norman Podhoretz's OP-ED|publisher=The Internet Brigade|year=1999|accessdate=September 3, 2007|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070927193354/http://www.buchanan.org/pma-99-1105-wallstjl.html|archivedate =September 27, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Now strongly urged to cancel the visit,<ref>Reeves, p. 249</ref> the president responded that it would be wrong to back down on a promise he had made to Chancellor Kohl.

Reagan announced a [[War on Drugs]] in 1982, in response to concerns about the increasing [[crack epidemic]].

====Response to AIDS epidemic====
The Reagan administration largely ignored the AIDS crisis, which began to unfold in the United States in 1981, the same year Reagan took office. AIDS research was chronically underfunded during Reagan's administration, and requests for more funding by doctors at the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) were routinely denied. By the end of the first 12 months of the epidemic, when more than 1,000 people had died of AIDS in the U.S., the CDC had spent less than $1 million on AIDS research. In contrast, funding had been made amply available to the CDC in their efforts to stop [[Legionnaires' disease]] after an outbreak in 1976; the CDC had spent $9 million in fighting [[1976 Philadelphia Legionnaires' disease outbreak|Legionnaires' disease]], though the outbreak had caused fewer than 50 deaths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/news/7046/rewriting-the-script-on-reagan-why-the-president|title=Rewriting the Script on Reagan: Why the President Ignored AIDS|author=Bronski, Michael|accessdate=March 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v3kgvUsV9tcC&lpg=PP1&dq=and%20the%20band%20played%20on&pg=PA214#v=onepage&q=%22In%20the%20first%20twelve%20months%20of%20the%20epidemic%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20CDC%20had%20spent%20$1%20million%20on%20the%20outbreak,%20compared%20with%20$9%20million%20on%20Legionnaire%E2%80%99s%20disease.%22%20%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20Reagan%20administration%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9Copposed%20the%20supplemental%20appropriation%E2%80%9D&f=false|title=And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic|author= Shilts, Randy|publisher= Macmillan|accessdate=March 12, 2016}}</ref>

====Immigration====
Reagan signed the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986|Immigration Reform and Control Act]] in 1986. The act made it illegal to knowingly hire or recruit [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]], required employers to attest to their employees' immigration status, and granted [[amnesty]] to approximately three million illegal immigrants who entered the United States before January 1, 1982, and had lived in the country continuously.

===Assault===
On April 13, 1992, Reagan was assaulted by an anti-nuclear protester during a luncheon speech while accepting an award from the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] in [[Las Vegas]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/16/us/protester-at-reagan-speech-had-press-credentials.html |title=Protester at Reagan Speech Had Press Credentials |work=The New York Times |accessdate=July 27, 2016}}</ref> The protester, 41-year old Richard Paul Springer, smashed a 2-foot-high (60&nbsp;cm) 30-pound (13.5&nbsp;kg) crystal statue of an eagle that the broadcasters had given the former president.

Complicating the picture, Reagan suffered an episode of head trauma in July 1989, five years before his diagnosis.

As the years went on, the disease slowly destroyed Reagan's mental capacity.<ref name="sr" /> He was only able to recognize a few people, including his wife, Nancy.<ref name="sr" /> He remained active, however; he took walks through parks near his home and on beaches, played golf regularly, and until 1999 he often went to his office in nearby [[Century City, Los Angeles|Century City]].<ref name="sr">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/05/us/reagan-s-twilight-a-special-report-a-president-fades-into-a-world-apart.html|title=Reagan's Twilight&nbsp;– A special report; A President Fades Into a World Apart|accessdate=June 18, 2008|author=Altman, Lawrence K|date=October 5, 1997|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

Opinions of Reagan's legacy among the country's leading policy makers and journalists differ as well. [[Edwin Feulner]], president of [[The Heritage Foundation]], said that Reagan "helped create a safer, freer world" and said of his economic policies: "He took an America suffering from 'malaise'... and made its citizens believe again in their destiny."<ref>{{cite web|last=Feulner|first=Edwin J.|url=http://www.heritage.org/Press/Commentary/ed060904b.cfm|title=The Legacy of Ronald Reagan|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|date=June 9, 2004|accessdate=August 23, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011205706/http://heritage.org/Press/Commentary/ed060904b.cfm|archivedate=October 11, 2007}}</ref> However, [[Mark Weisbrot]], co-Director of the [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]], contended that Reagan's "economic policies were mostly a failure"<ref>{{cite web|last=Weisbrot|first=Mark|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0607-09.htm|title=Ronald Reagan's Legacy|publisher=Common Dreams News Center|date=June 7, 2004|accessdate=August 23, 2007}}</ref> while [[Howard Kurtz]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' opined that Reagan was "a far more controversial figure in his time than the largely gushing obits on television would suggest."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kurtz|first=Howard|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21671-2004Jun7.html|title=Reagan: The Retake|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 7, 2004|accessdate=August 25, 2005}}</ref>

Despite the continuing debate surrounding his legacy, many conservative and liberal scholars agree that Reagan has been the most influential president since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], leaving his imprint on American politics, diplomacy, culture, and economics through his effective communication, dedicated patriotism and pragmatic compromising.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://millercenter.org/president/reagan/essays/biography/8|title=American President|accessdate=October 7, 2014}}</ref> Since he left office, historians have reached a consensus,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Henry|first1=David|title=Ronald Reagan and the 1980s: Perceptions, Policies, Legacies.

Reagan has become an iconic figure in the Republican Party, with praise for his accomplishments part of the standard GOP rhetoric a quarter century after his retirement. ''Washington Post'' reporter Carlos Lozada notes how in the 2016 presidential race the main Republican contenders adopted "standard GOP Gipper worship," including even [[Donald Trump]], who previously had been skeptical.<ref>Carlos Lozada, "I just binge-read eight books by Donald Trump.

The period of American history most dominated by Reagan and his policies concerning taxes, welfare, defense, the federal judiciary and the [[Cold War]] is known today as the [[Reagan Era]], and emphasizes that the conservative "Reagan Revolution," led by Reagan, had a permanent impact on the United States in domestic and foreign policy. The [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton administration]] is often treated as an extension of the Reagan Era, as is the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W.
