:''"Primary market" may also refer to [[Art_valuation#Primary_and_secondary_markets|a market in art valuation]].''

The '''primary market''' is the part of the [[capital market]] that deals with issuing of new securities. Primary markets create long term instruments through which corporate entities raise funds from the capital market. 

In a primary market, companies, governments or public sector institutions can raise funds through [[bond issue]]s and corporations can raise capital through the sale of new [[stock]] through an [[initial public offering]] (IPO). This is often done through an [[investment bank]] or [[syndicate#Finance syndicates|finance syndicate]] of securities dealers. The process of selling new shares to investors is called [[underwriting]]. Dealers earn a commission that is built into the price of the security offering, though it can be found in the [[prospectus (finance)|prospectus]]. 

Instead of going through underwriters, corporations can make a '''primary issue''' of its debt or stock, which involves the issue by a corporation of its own debt or new stock directly to institutional investors or the public or it can seek additional capital from existing shareholders.

Once issued the securities typically trade on a [[secondary market]] such as a [[stock exchange]], [[bond market]] or [[derivatives exchange]].
