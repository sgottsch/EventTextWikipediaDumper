__NOTOC__
Year '''123''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CXXIII]]''') was a [[common year starting on Thursday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Paetinus and Apronius''' (or, less frequently, '''year 876 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 123 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
