A '''swagman''' (also called a '''swaggie''', '''sundowner''' or '''tussocker''') is an old [[Australia]]n<ref>Brian Galligan and Winsome Roberts (2004). ''Australian citizenship'', p. 108.

Updated 23 November 2009.</ref> term describing an [[underclass]] of transient temporary workers, who travelled by foot from farm to farm carrying the traditional [[Swag (bedroll)|swag]] (bedroll). 

Particularly during the Depression of the 1890s and the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, unemployed men travelled the rural areas of Australia on foot, their few meagre possessions rolled up and carried in their swag. Typically, they would seek work in farms and towns they travelled through, and in many cases the farmers, if no permanent work was available, would provide food and shelter in return for some menial task.

==Etymology==
In the early 1800s, the term ''swag'' was used by British thieves to describe any amount of stolen goods. One definition given in [[Francis Grose]]'s 1811 ''Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue'' is "any [[wiktionary:booty|booty]] you have lately obtained,.... To carry the swag is to be the bearer of the stolen goods to a place of safety."<ref>Grose, Francis; Egan, Pierce (1923). ''Grose's Classical dictionary of the vulgar tongue: revised and corrected, with the addition of numerous slang phrases, collected from tried authorities''. London: Sherwood, Neely, and Jones.</ref> [[James Hardy Vaux]], a convict in Australia, used the term for similar purposes in his memoirs written in 1812 and published in 1819.<ref>Vaux, Hardy James; Field, Barron (1819). "Memoirs of James Hardy Vaux, Volumes 1-2". Printed by W. Clowes. p. 216</ref> By the 1830s, the term in Australia had transferred from meaning goods acquired by a thief to the possessions and daily necessaries carried by a bushman. The compound ''swagman'' and colloquial variation ''swaggie'' first appeared in the 1850s during the [[Goldrush#Gold rushes by region|Australian gold rushes]], alongside less common terms such as ''bundleman''.<ref>Leitner, Gerhard (2004). ''Australia's many voices: Australian English--the national language''. [[Walter de Gruyter]]. ISBN 3-11-018194-0, p. 218</ref> New Zealanders adopted the term in the 1880s, where swagmen were also known as ''swaggers''.<ref>Collins, Peter; Peters, Pam; Smith, Adam (2009). ''Comparative studies in Australian and New Zealand English: grammar and beyond''. Amsterdam: [[John Benjamins Publishing Company]].

==History==
[[Image:Down on his luck.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Down on His Luck]]'', painted by [[Frederick McCubbin]] in 1889, depicts a melancholic swagman "on the Wallaby"]]
Before motor transport became common, the Australian wool industry was heavily dependent on itinerant [[Sheep shearing|shearers]] who carried their swags from farm to farm (called properties or "[[Station (Australian agriculture)|station]]s" in Australia), but would not in general have taken kindly to being called "swagmen". Outside of the shearing season their existence was frugal, and this possibly explains the tradition (of past years) of [[sheep station]]s in particular providing enough food to last until the next station even when no work was available. Some were especially noted for their hospitality, such as [[Canowie Station]] in South Australia which around 1903 provided over 2,000 sundowners each year with their customary two meals and a bed.<ref>Register newspaper, 14 December 1903, page 8.</ref>

A romanticised figure, the swagman is famously referred to in the song "[[Waltzing Matilda]]", by [[Banjo Paterson]], which tells of a swagman who turns to stealing a sheep from the local [[Squatter (pastoral)|squatter]].

The economic depressions of the 1860s and 1890s saw an increase in these itinerant workers. During these periods it was seen as 'mobilising the workforce'. At one point it was rumoured that a "Matilda Waltzers' Union" had been formed to give representation to swagmen at the [[Federation of Australia]] in 1901.

During the early years of the 1900s, the introduction of the pension and the dole reduced the numbers of swagmen to those who preferred the free lifestyle. During [[World War I|World War One]] many were called up for duty and fought at [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] as [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|ANZACs]]. The song "[[And The Band Played Waltzing Matilda]]" tells the story of a swagman who fought at Gallipoli.

The numbers of swagmen have declined over the 20th century, but still rising in times of economic depression. Swagmen remain a romantic icon of Australian history and folklore.

Swags are still heavily used, particularly in Australia, by overlanders. There are still a large number of manufacturers actively making both standard and custom-design swags.

Swagmen were often victims of circumstance who had found themselves homeless. Others were rovers by choice, or else they were on the run from police ([[bushrangers]]). Many were [[Europe]]an or [[Asia]]n migrants seeking fortune on the [[Goldfields region of Victoria|goldfields]]. One such swagman was Welshman [[Joseph Jenkins]], who travelled throughout Victoria between 1869 and 1894, documenting his experiences in daily diary entries and through poetry.<ref>[http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/our-collections/treasures-curios/diary-welsh-swagman The Dairy of a Welsh Swagman, a treasure of the State Library of Victoria], online.slv.vic.gov.au. Retrieved on 16 January 2011.</ref> Swagmen ranged in age from teenagers to the elderly. Socialist leader [[John A.

H. McLintock, originally published in 1966.</ref> and also featured directly in some of his other books. Novelist [[Donald Stuart (novelist)|Donald Stuart]] also began his life as a swagman at age 14. Several of his novels follow the lives of swagmen and aborigines in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimbereley]] and [[Pilbara]] regions of Western Australia. Many swagmen interacted with aborigines along their travels; bushwear designer [[R.M. Williams]] spent his latter teen years as a swagman travelling across the [[Nullarbor Plain]], picking up bushcraft and survival skills from local aboriginal tribes such as cutting [[Acacia aneura|mulga]], tracking kangaroos and finding water.

At times they would have been seen in and around urban areas looking for work or a handout. Most eyewitness descriptions of swagmen were written during the period when the country was 'riding on the sheep's back'. At this time, rovers were offered rations at police stations as an early form of the [[Work for the Dole|dole payment]]. They roamed the countryside finding work as sheep shearers or as farm hands. Not all were hard workers. Some swagmen known as ''[[sundowner]]s'' would arrive at homesteads or stations at sundown when it was too late to work, taking in a meal and disappearing before work started the next morning. The New Zealand equivalent of a sundowner was known as a ''tussocker''.<ref name=baker>Baker, John Sidney (1941).

Most existed with few possessions as they were limited by what they could carry. Generally they had a [[swag (bedroll)|swag]] (canvas bedroll), a tucker bag (bag for carrying food) and some cooking implements which may have included a [[billy can]] (tea pot or stewing pot). They carried flour for making [[Damper (food)|damper]] and sometimes some meat for a stew.

In [[Henry Lawson]]'s short story ''The Romance of the Swag'', he describes in detail how to make a dinky-die Aussie swag. Lawson states,"Travelling with the swag in Australia is variously and picteresguely described as "humping bluey", "walking Matilda", "humping Matilda", "humping your drum", "being on the wallaby", "jabbing trotters", and "tea and sugar burglaring".<ref>{{cite book|title=Henry Lawson, Selected Stories|publisher=[[Angus & Robertson|A&R Classics]]|pages=449–454|isbn=978-0207197086|year=2002|last1=Lawson|first1=Henry|authorlink=Henry Lawson}}</ref>

Swagmen traveled with fellow 'swaggies' for periods, walking where they had to go, hitch hiking or stowing aboard cargo trains to get around. They slept on the ground next to a campfire, in hollowed out trees or under bridges.

In the 19th century, Australian [[bush poetry]] grew in popularity alongside an emerging sense of [[Australian nationalism]]. The swagman was venerated in poetry and literature as symbolic of Australian nationalistic and egalitarian ideals. Popular poems about swagmen include [[Henry Lawson]]'s ''Out Back'' (1893) and [[Shaw Neilson]]'s ''The Sundowner'' (1908). In 1902, [[Barbara Baynton]] published a collection of short stories titled ''[[Bush Studies]]''. The final story, "[[The Chosen Vessel]]" (1896), gives an account of a woman alone in a bush dwelling, where she is preyed upon and eventually raped and murdered by a passing swagman. This was in stark contrast to traditional bush lore, where swagmen are depicted in distinctly romantic terms. Swagmen were also prominent in the works of those associated with the [[Jindyworobak Movement]], including poet [[Roland Robinson (poet)|Roland Robinson]], who was a swagman for much of his life before [[World War II]].

Coinciding with trends in 19th-century Australian literature, swagmen were popular subjects of contemporary painters and illustrators. Drawings of swagmen, itinerant bush workers, rural nomads and other men "on the wallaby" were prevalent in newspapers and picturesque atlases. [[ST Gill]] and [[James Alfred Turner]] popularized the open-air life of the swagman. By the 1880s, swagmen featured in the works of [[Tom Roberts]], [[Walter Withers]], [[Arthur Streeton]], [[Frederick McCubbin]], and other artists associated with the Melbourne-based [[Heidelberg School]], which is customarily held to be the first distinctly Australian movement in Western art and the "golden age of national idealism" in Australian painting.<ref>Astbury, Leigh. ''City Bushmen: the Heidelberg School and the Rural Mythology''. Melbourne: [[Oxford University Press]], 1985. ISBN 0-19-554501-X</ref>

Swagmen and other characters of the bush were popular subjects of the [[Australian films: 1896–1919|silent film era of Australian cinema]]. [[Raymond Longford]]'s 1914 ''[[The Swagman's Story]]'' starred [[Lottie Lyell]]. 1936's ''[[The Flying Doctor]]'' was directed by [[Miles Mander]] and starred [[Charles Farrell]] as a swagman travelling through the [[Blue Mountains, New South Wales|Blue Mountains]] towards [[Sydney]]. Swagmen have been the subject of numerous books including the 1955 novel ''The Shiralee'' by [[D'Arcy Niland]], which was made into a [[The Shiralee (1957 film)|1957 film]], starring [[Peter Finch]] (who himself lived as a swagman during early adulthood<ref>Dundy, Elaine (1980). ''Finch, Bloody Finch: A Biography of Peter Finch''. [[New York City]]: [[Henry Holt and Company]]. p. 166. ISBN 0-03-041796-1.</ref>), and a [[The Shiralee (1987 film)|1987 TV mini-series]], starring [[Bryan Brown]]. [[Norman Kaye]] played the role of a swagman in the 1976 [[bushranger]] film ''[[Mad Dog Morgan]]''.<ref>Bertand, Ina; Mayer, Geoff; McFarlane, Brian (1999). ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Film''. [[Oxford University Press]]. p. 245. ISBN 0-19-553797-1.</ref> [[Arthur Upfield]] wrote a number of novels about swagmen including ''Death of a Swagman'' (1942), ''The Bushman Who Came Back'' (1957) and ''Madman's Bend'' (1963). In the [[Dot and the Kangaroo#Film adaptations|1981 film adaptation]] of [[Ethel Pedley]]'s 1899 children's book ''[[Dot and the Kangaroo]]'', a magical swagman helps Dot find Mother Kangaroo's lost [[Joey (marsupial)|joey]].<ref>Caputo, Raffaele; Murray, Scott; Tanskaya, Alissa (1995). ''Australian Film, 1978-1994: A Survey of Theatrical Features''. Oxford University Press. p. 400. ISBN 0-19-553777-7.</ref> The Scottish singer-songwriter [[Alistair Hulett]] wrote a song about the 'swaggies' called "The Swaggies Have All Waltzed Matilda Away".

In the 1946 [[Sherlock Holmes]] film ''[[Dressed to Kill (1946 film)|Dressed to Kill]]'', a tune called "The Swagman", heard on an old music box, plays an important role in solving the mystery.
