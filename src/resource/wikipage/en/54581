==History==

===Early history===
[[File:Alternative subway logo.svg|thumb|Former Subway logo (1968–2002)]]
In 1965, [[Fred DeLuca]] borrowed $1,000 from friend [[Peter Buck (restaurateur)|Peter Buck]] to start "Pete's Super Submarines" in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], and in the following year they formed Doctor's Associates Inc. to oversee operations of the restaurants as the franchise expanded.<ref name="History">{{cite web|url=http://www.subway.com/subwayroot/about_us/TimeLine.aspx|title=Subway Timeline|publisher=Doctor's Associates Inc.|accessdate=December 29, 2012}}</ref> The holding company derives its name from DeLuca's goal to earn enough from the business to pay tuition for medical school, as well as Buck's having a doctorate in physics.<ref name="BOWDOINLHD">[http://web.archive.org/web/20080908035958/http://www.bowdoin.edu/events/commencement/honorands.shtml 2008 Honorary Degree Recipients (Bowdoin, Office of Events and Summer Programs)] (archived 2008)</ref> Doctor's Associates is not affiliated with, nor endorsed by, any medical organization.<ref>{{cite news|title=From Small Business To Big Business: Doctor’s Associates Inc.

Subway also sells [[breakfast sandwich]]es, [[English muffin]]s, and [[flatbread]]. In 2006, "personal pizzas" debuted in some US markets. These are [[Build to order|made to order]] (like their subs) and heated for 85 seconds. Breakfast and pizza items are only available in some stores. In November 2009, Subway signed a deal to serve exclusively [[Seattle's Best Coffee]] coffee as part of their breakfast menu in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.starbucks.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=292 |title=Subway Restaurants to Brew Seattle's Best Coffee Exclusively |publisher=News.starbucks.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}</ref>

A 2009 [[Zagat]] survey named Subway the best provider of "Healthy Options" (in the "Mega Chain" category). Subway was also first in "Top Service" and "Most Popular" rankings. It placed second in "Top Overall", behind [[Wendy's]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qsrmagazine.com/articles/features/129/zagat-1.phtml?microsite=bytopic_finance&utm_campaign=20090609&utm_source=jolt&utm_medium=email |title=ZAGAT Survey Summary 2009 Fast-Food Restaurants Survey |publisher=QSR Magazine |accessdate=February 17, 2011}}</ref>

===Regional variations===
Subway's menu varies between countries, most significantly where there are religious requirements relating to the meats served.

In 2006, the first [[Subway Israel#Other kosher Subways|kosher Subway]] restaurant in the United States opened, in a suburb of [[Cleveland, Ohio]] in the Mandel JCC of Cleveland. Former Subway spokesman [[Jared Fogle]] attended the opening. A [[press release]] stated, "With slight modifications, such as no pork-based products, and the use of soy-based cheese product, the menu is virtually identical to that of any other Subway restaurant."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pr.com/press-release/13250 |title=First Kosher Subway Restaurant Opens in Cleveland |publisher=Pr.com |date=2006-06-06 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}</ref> Other openings soon followed, briefly making Subway one of the largest U.S. kosher restaurant chains.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fishkoff |first=Sue |url=http://www.jta.org/2009/08/05/life-religion/eat-fresh-eat-kosher-subway-the-largest-u-s-kosher-restaurant-chain |title=Eat fresh, eat kosher: Subway the largest U.S. kosher restaurant chain |publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |date=Aug 5, 2009 |accessdate=Feb 26, 2016}}</ref> At their peak, 12 kosher Subway locations were open in the U.S, including Kansas City and 5 in New York.

Subway opened its first restaurant in [[India]] in 2001 in [[New Delhi]]. Subway restaurants in India do not serve [[beef]] and [[pork]] products in deference to [[Hindu]] and [[Muslim]] beliefs respectively, and sell an extended vegetarian range due to the large number of vegetarians in the country. There are 395 Subway restaurants in 68 cities of India as of January 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.subway.co.in/page_about_us.html# |title=Franchise For Subway,Top 10 Fast Food Franchises,Restaurant,Restaurants Fast Food |publisher=Subway.co.in |date=|accessdate=2012-10-26}}</ref> On September 4, 2012, Subway opened its first all-vegetarian outlet on the campus of [[Lovely Professional University]] (LPU) in [[Jalandhar]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Rohan Dua |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-08-17/chandigarh/33248095_1_subway-outlet-vegetarian-preparations-vegetarian-products |title=Subway to roll out world's 1st all-veg outlet in Punjab&nbsp;— Times Of India |publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2012-08-17 |accessdate=2012-10-26}}</ref> On March 6, 2013, Subway opened its second all-vegetarian outlet also offering Jain food in [[Paldi]], [[Ahmedabad]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Chitra Unnithan  |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-03-06/ahmedabad/37498833_1_vegetarian-cuisine-vegetarian-food-durlabh-singh |title=US food giants turn vegetarian in Gujarat&nbsp;— Times Of India |publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2013-03-06 |accessdate=2013-10-29}}</ref>

===Nutritional content===
In 2011, Subway introduced gluten-free bread and brownies to some locations in Texas.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.cbs19.tv/story/13818841/gluten-free-items-come-to-some-subways-in-east-texas?clienttype=printable | work=KYTX CBS 19 | first=Amanda | last=Roberson | title=Gluten-free items come to some Subway's in East Texas | accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> It also cut the salt content of its sandwiches by 15 percent.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.whec.com/news/stories/s2071937.shtml | work=WHEC News 10 | title=Subway slashes salt in sandwiches | date=April 19, 2011}}</ref>

==Advertising==
[[File:Subway2.JPG|right|thumb|Subway in [[Belo Horizonte]], Brazil. (2009)]]
Subway is the second-biggest [[fast food advertising|fast food advertiser]] in the United States, behind only [[McDonald's]]. It spent US$516,000,000 on measurable advertising in 2012.<ref>[http://adage.com/article/news/meet-america-s-25-biggest-advertisers/242969/?qwr=FullSite Meet America's 25 biggest advertisers]. ''AdAge''. Retrieved July 8, 2013.</ref>

Subway uses the advertising slogan "Eat Fresh", and focuses on how their sandwiches are made from freshly baked bread and fresh ingredients, in front of customers to their exact specifications, by employees whom Subway calls "Subway Sandwich Artists".

In November 2007, Subway's US commercials featured the cartoon character [[Peter Griffin]] (from ''[[Family Guy]]'') promoting its new Subway Feast sandwich.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/subway-family-guy-promotion-155309 |title=Subway in 'Family Guy' promotion |author=Gail Schille |publisher=[[the Hollywood Reporter]] |date=November 17, 2007 |accessdate=June 26, 2013 |quote=Fox's "Family Guy" has lined up its first national quick service restaurant promotion with Subway Restaurants, which will air a TV spot featuring the show's Peter Griffin}}</ref> Subway has also used "instant win" games, based on the game [[Scrabble]].

Subway ran a [[product placement]] campaign in the US TV series ''[[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]'' since its first season. As ratings dwindled in the second season, a campaign to "save Chuck" was launched for fans, encouraging them to purchase a footlong sub from Subway on April 27, 2009, the date of the season finale. Tony Pace, Subway's marketing officer, called it the best product placement the restaurant chain has done "in several years."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvweek.com/tvmojoe/2009/04/subway-good-night-and-good-chu.php |title=Subway: Good Night, and Good 'Chuck' |publisher=TV Week |date=April 27, 2009 |accessdate=April 27, 2009}}</ref>

To celebrate National Sandwich Day on November 3, 2015, Subway offered a Buy One sandwich, Give One sandwich free promotion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Subway Offers Buy One Get One Free Sandwiches on Nov. 3|url=http://time.com/money/4096792/subway-bogo-national-sandwich-day/|website=Time|accessdate=3 November 2015}}</ref>

===Jared Fogle===
[[File:Jared_Fogle_(2007).jpg|thumb|Fogle in 2007]]
[[Jared Fogle]] was a national spokesman for the company in the US starting in January 2000, giving talks on healthy living and appearing in advertisements.  Fogle first came to attention in his native [[Indiana]] by claiming that he lost over 200 pounds in part by eating at Subway. From 2008, he was featured less often as the company marketed with more emphasis on their "5 dollar footlong" campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://finance.yahoo.com/career-work/article/108119/the-accidental-hero.html?mod=career-selfemployment|title=The Accidental Hero|author=Matthew Boyle|publisher=[[Yahoo!

In December 2015, following the removal of Fogle from its marketing, Subway introduced a new marketing campaign, "Founded on Fresh". The campaign focuses upon Subway's establishment and early history, and features [[Fred DeLuca]], as played by his son, Jonathon. The new campaign downplays the use of jingles and celebrity endorsements (besides "targeted" sports marketing), in favor of focusing upon the qualities of its products, and specific products. Chief advertising officer Chris Carroll explained that the focus on fat, calories, and weight loss were "what fresh used to be", and that the new campaign would focus more on the sourcing of Subway's ingredients, such as its phase-out of [[Antibiotic use in livestock|antibiotic-treated meat]]. Carroll also explained that the new strategy was being developed prior to the controversy involving Fogle.<ref name="adage-foundedonfresh">{{cite web|title=Behind Subway's Post-Jared Strategy: No More Discount Ads, Fewer Celebs|url=http://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/subway-s-strategy-discount-ads/301938/|website=Advertising Age|accessdate=8 February 2016}}</ref>

===$5 footlongs===
{{details|Subway $5 footlong promotion}}
In 2008, Subway began to offer all foot-long submarine sandwiches (excluding premium and double-meat varieties) for five dollars, in the continental United States and Canada, as a "limited time only" promotion. "Five Dollar Footlongs" quickly became the company's most successful promotion ever.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brandchannel.com/home/post/2010/05/19/Subway-Sues-Over-Footlong.aspx |title=Did Subway Put Its Foot(long) In Its Mouth? |publisher=Brandchannel.com |date=|accessdate=2013-06-05}}</ref> Upon the initial promotion's completion, customer response prompted Subway to create a permanent "$5 Footlong Everyday Value Menu" that offered some footlong sandwiches for $5. As of 2011, there has been a monthly rotating $5 footlong.<ref>{{cite web|last=Boyle |first=Matthew |url=http://finance.yahoo.com/career-work/article/108119/the-accidental-hero.html?mod=career-selfemployment |title=The Accidental Hero - Yahoo! Finance |publisher=Finance.yahoo.com |date=2009-11-10 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}</ref> Which subs are permanently priced at $5 varies by market.

In October 2011, a similar promotion was launched in the United Kingdom. Customers can buy one of nine subs and any drink for £3 (for a six-inch sub) or £5 (for a footlong).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.subway.co.uk/menu/subs/value-lunch/default.aspx |title=Eat Fresh |publisher=Subway |date=|accessdate=2012-10-26}}</ref> On November 1, 2014, Subway discontinued the five dollar footlong promotion, replacing it with the $6 six-inch select with a drink and a choice of cookies or chips.

===Sub Club===
[[File:SubClub.JPG|thumb|Sub Club Cards and Sub Club stamps]]
In early June 2005, Subway announced its first customer reward program would be phased out due to counterfeiting. The "Sub Club" program was discontinued in September 2013 by Doctor's Associates.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archive.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2005/09/68909|title=Fraud Sinks Subway's Sub Club|work=WIRED|accessdate=28 October 2014|date=September 21, 2005}}</ref>

Participating Subway restaurants in the U.S. and Canada offer a "Subway Card" to customers, which functions as a stored-value cash card. In some states and provinces, the card also functions as a "Subway Rewards Card", allowing customers to earn points for free food and sandwiches. Unlike in the "Sub Club" program, no other purchase is needed when redeeming points, and registered cards can be replaced if lost or stolen.<ref>{{cite web | title=Subway Card FAQ | url=https://www.mysubwaycard2.com/ContentManager/Controller.aspx?page=English/faq/faq | accessdate=November 1, 2009}}</ref> Subway runs periodic promotions in which it gives away free subs to customers who pre-load a Subway Card with certain dollar amounts, usually listed at [http://www.mysubwaycard.com mysubwaycard.com].

All stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland participate in the Subcard system, offering customers points with each purchase at a Subway store, which are redeemable for subs and snacks. Unlike in the US system, these cards cannot be used to store cash. The program was rolled out in Germany, and other parts of Europe from 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://subcard.subway.co.uk/ |title=SUBCARD |publisher=Subway |date=|accessdate=2013-06-05}}</ref>

===Sandwich size===
On February 2, 2007, [[KNXV|KNXV-TV]] (with the help of the Arizona Department of Weights and Measures) reported that three of Subway's "Giant Sub" sandwiches, nominally each {{convert|3|ft|cm|adj=on}} long, were actually {{convert|2|ft|8|in|cm}}, {{convert|2|ft|8.25|in|cm}}, and {{convert|2|ft|8.5|in|cm}} long. The maximum variance in length allowed in Arizona is 3% ({{convert|1.08|in|cm}}, for a three-foot sub). The report also showed the boxes designed to store these sandwiches were {{convert|2|ft|10.75|in|cm}} in length; shorter than the maximum allowable variance. In response to the report, Subway stated they were reevaluating their advertising, training and packaging materials with regard to the specific or implied length of Giant Subs, and were advising their franchisees to only discuss with customers the approximate number of expected servings and not a specific length of measurement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc15.com/content/news/investigators/story.aspx?content_id=cf4c217c-1910-4040-9a33-0102fdd135c7  |title=Sub-Standard |author=Joe Ducey |publisher=[[KNXV-TV]] ([[Phoenix, Arizona]]) |date=June 26, 2007 |accessdate=April 8, 2008 |quote=<nowiki>His [Dennis Ehrhard] office [Phoenix Dept. of Weights and Measures] recently warned Subway, for shorting a customer and the ABC 15 Investigators found Subway was the biggest offender in our test. </nowiki>|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070818130828/http://www.abc15.com/content/news/investigators/story.aspx?content_id=cf4c217c-1910-4040-9a33-0102fdd135c7 |archivedate = August 18, 2007}}  [http://consumerist.com/consumer/videos/subways-3-foot-subs-are-shorter-than-3-feet-276511.php Video]</ref>

In January 2013, an Australian teen, Matt Corby, complained on [[Facebook]] that Subway's "footlong" sandwich was only {{convert|11|in|cm}} long, rather than {{convert|1|foot|cm}}. Subway responded by saying, "With regards to the size of the bread and calling it a footlong, 'Subway Footlong' is a registered trademark as a descriptive name for the sub sold in Subway Restaurants and not intended to be a measurement of length."<ref>{{cite news|title=Subway explains shortness of their 'Footlong' sandwiches: It’s just the name of the sub|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/our_hoagies_beyond_measure_subway_Z1w7n2XPaDKnECTnpbN9rI?utm_source=SFnewyorkpost&utm_medium=SFnewyorkpost|publisher=New York Post|accessdate=19 January 2013|first=Dan|last=Mangan|date=January 19, 2013}}</ref> In most [[metrication|metricated]] countries such as Australia, the [[foot (length)|foot]] is no longer a government recognized unit of measurement.

===Franchise relations===
In 1995, Subway Sandwich Shops, Fred DeLuca, Peter Buck, and Doctor's Associates Inc. were held liable for breach of contract. An Illinois jury awarded more than $10 million in damages to Nicholas and Victoria Jannotta after finding lease and contract violations. The plaintiffs claimed the defendants had misrepresented the asset value of Subway Sandwich Shops (a leasing company used by Doctor's Associates for franchising purposes) while negotiating a 1985 lease agreement.<ref name="NationsRestaurantNews">{{cite news| title = Subway ordered to pay $10M in punitive damages to ex-landlord| author=Robin Lee Allen  | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_n49_v29/ai_17847096/| date = December 11, 1995| accessdate = August 8, 2011| work=Nation's Restaurant News}}</ref>

The U.S. House of Representatives' small business committee studied the franchise industry from 1992 to 1998. Dean Sagar noted, "Subway is the biggest problem in franchising and emerges as one of the key examples of every abuse you can think of."<ref name="FortuneMagazine">{{cite news| title = Why Subway Is 'The Biggest Problem In Franchising' That's the assessment of a congressional staffer who studied| author=Richard Behar  | url = http://nextraterrestrial.com/pdf/FDeluca-Fortune%20March%2016%201998.htm| work=Forbes Magazine| date = March 16, 1998| accessdate = August 8, 2011}}</ref> In 1989, the U.S. Small Business Administration refused small business loans to Subway franchise owners until Subway removed a contract clause which gave it power to seize and purchase any franchise without cause.

===United Kingdom VAT treatment===
In October 2010, Subway franchisees in the United Kingdom lost a high court appeal, against paying standard [[Value-added tax|VAT]] on all toasted subs, as required by [[HM Revenue and Customs]]. Thus, in the United Kingdom, a toasted sub attracts VAT, whereas a cold sub, eaten off the premises, does not. Competitors such as [[Quiznos]] & [[McDonald's]] do not pay VAT on similar food.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/local-west-yorkshire-news/2011/01/04/subway-wrangle-over-vat-could-be-heading-to-high-court-86081-27927214/ |title=Subway wrangle over VAT could be heading to high court | publisher=The Huddersfield Daily Examiner |date=January 4, 2011 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taxation.co.uk/taxation/node/21166 |title=Big butties, small mindedness |publisher=Taxation |date=October 20, 2010 |accessdate=February 17, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://howladerandco.com/subway-vat-appeal-subway-loses/337/ |title=Subway VAT appeal: Subway loses |publisher=Howlader & Co |date=November 4, 2010 |accessdate=January 17, 2011}}</ref>

In March 2012, [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[George Osborne]] announced plans to close the loophole that allows Subway competitors to offer hot food without paying VAT. This legislation was expected to come into force from October 2012 onward,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17468868 | work=BBC News | title=Budget 2012: VAT move could 'hit cost of bacon rolls' | date=March 21, 2012}}</ref> but the government withdrew plans to charge VAT on originally hot food being allowed to cool naturally on 28 May 2012.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18244640 | work=BBC News | title=Government does U-turn over 'Cornish pasty tax' | date=May 28, 2012}}</ref> In June 2012, Subway launched the "Toast the Tax" campaign to put pressure on [[Government of the United Kingdom|the government]] to drop VAT on toasted sandwiches, as it has done for hot savouries.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shaw |first=Martin |url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/local-west-yorkshire-news/2012/06/16/david-cameron-of-birkby-v-david-cameron-of-downing-street-in-toastie-tax-row-full-details-here-86081-31194155/ |title=David Cameron of Birkby v David Cameron of Downing Street in toastie tax row - full details here - Local West Yorkshire News - News - Huddersfield Examiner |publisher=Examiner.co.uk |date=2012-06-24 |accessdate=2013-06-05}}</ref>

===Casey's trademark case against Subway===
On January 31, 2011, Subway lawyer, Valerie Pochron, wrote to [[Casey's General Stores]], a chain of Iowa-based convenience stores, demanding the small chain to cease using the term "footlong" in advertisements for its 12-inch sandwiches. Subway threatened to sue. Consequently, in February 2011, Casey's General Stores Inc. filed a petition in a U.S. District Court in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], seeking a legal declaration that the word "footlong" does not violate Subway's rights.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2011-02-14-subway-caseys-footlong-suit_N.htm |title=Casey's sues Subway over rights to 'footlong' |work=USA Today  |date=July 16, 2010 |accessdate=February 17, 2011}}</ref> Casey's further sought a declaration that the word "footlong' is a generic description of a sandwich measuring one foot.<ref>{{cite web|last=Welte |first=Melanie S. |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41584626/ns/business-small_business/ |title=Iowa store chain sues Subway over 'footlong' |publisher=MSNBC |date=February 14, 2011 |accessdate=February 17, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://ia600409.us.archive.org/32/items/gov.uscourts.iasd.43593/gov.uscourts.iasd.43593.1.0.pdf | title=Complaint, Casey's v.

Subway's trademark application for "footlong" has yet to be approved by the federal government.  Subway has attempted to register it with the  [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] twice.  They filed on November 8, 2007<ref>{{cite web | url=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=77324328&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch | title=U. S.

===Ingredients===
Subway made alterations to its bread after food blogger and activist [[Vani Hari]] gathered more than 50,000 signatures in a [[petition]] drive. Subway removed [[azodicarbonamide]] from its bread.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.subway.com/subwayroot/about_us/PR_Docs/QualityBread.pdf | title = Our Commitment to Our Customers: Serving Quality Products Subway Introduces Azo Free Bread in US and Canada | publisher = subway.com}}</ref> Before Vani Hari's petition, Subway had used azodicarbonamide as a bread conditioner, to whiten the dough and allow [[sandwich bread]] to bake more quickly.
