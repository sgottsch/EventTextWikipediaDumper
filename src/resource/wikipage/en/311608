The '''Battle of Latakia''' ({{lang-ar|معركة اللاذقية}}; {{lang-he|קרב לטקיה}}) was a small but revolutionary naval action of the [[Yom Kippur War]], fought on 7 October 1973 between [[Israel]] and [[Syria]]. It was the first naval battle in history to see combat between [[surface-to-surface missile]]-equipped [[missile boat]]s and the use of [[Electronic warfare|electronic deception]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Lerner|first=Adi |title=The Untold Story of Naval Heroism in the Yom Kippur War|url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/54/ART2/293/839.html |accessdate=7 October 2011 |newspaper=[[Maariv]]|date=7 October 2011|language=Hebrew}}</ref>

==Background==
At the outset of hostilities, the [[Israeli Navy]] set out to destroy the naval capabilities of the Syrians, who were equipped with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Komar-class missile boat|Komar-class]] and [[Osa-class missile boat|Osa-class]] missile boats. The Syrian missile boats were equipped with Soviet manufactured [[P-15 Termit]] ([[NATO reporting name]]: SS-N-2 ''Styx'') [[anti-ship missile]]s with twice the range of the Israeli [[Gabriel (missile)|Gabriel]] anti-ship missiles.<ref>Rabonovich, ''The Boats of Cherbourg'', pp. 256–262.</ref>

==Battle==
[[File:SaarsReturn7101973.jpg|thumb|left|The Israeli missile boats return to their base in Haifa following the battle]]
At the beginning of the 73 war, the Israeli Navy carried out a raid against the Syrian port of Latakia. For this, the Israelis sent five missile boats and two landing ships with four helicopters. The helicopters had ESM, Chaff and Mechanical/Electronic echo enhancement equipment. The aim of the strike force was to carry out missile and gun attacks on the Syrian port. The helicopters were to be used for surface surveillance, EW, gun spotting, and as decoys.

The four Israeli Navy [[Sa'ar 3-class missile boat|Sa'ar 3-class]] and one [[Sa'ar 4-class missile boat|Sa'ar 4-class]] missile boats headed towards the Syrian [[port of Latakia]] in two parallel columns. In the western column were the missile boats ''Miznak'' (Blast), ''Ga'ash'' (Storm), and ''Hanit'' (Spear); the eastern column was composed of the missile boats ''Mivtach'' (Reliance) and ''Reshef'' (Spark).

The Israeli Missile boats were detected by a patrolling Syrian torpedo boat and this detection was reported to the base. But before any reinforcements could be sent, at 22:28 hours the Israelis encountered the Syrian K-123 [[torpedo boat]] which was attacked using Gabriel SSMs and sunk by 76 mm gunfire from ''Mivtach'' and ''Hanit''. As they headed toward the shore, the Israeli ships engaged a 560-ton Syrian [[T43-class minesweeper]] and also sank it, this time using four Gabriel anti-ship missiles. At 23:30 the Israelis made contact with two Syrian [[Komar-class missile boat|Komar-class]] and one [[Osa-class missile boat]]s. The Israeli force turned East South Eastwards, and the helicopters climbed high so as to start painting on the shore radar at Lakatia. In the meantime 3 patrolling Syrian missile boats, from off Bans, were vectored north-westwards to attack the Israeli formation of 7 radar contacts (3 of chaff and 4 helicopters) at about 2330, the Syrians launched 8-12 Styx missiles at the Israeli formation, which subsequently disappeared from the Syrian radar. The Syrian missile boats fired their Styx missiles at long range, but as the missiles approached, the Israelis employed [[electronic countermeasures]] and launched [[Chaff (radar countermeasure)|chaff]] rockets to successfully decoy the missiles. When the Israeli ships closed the range, they fired five Gabriel missiles, sinking one Komar and the Osa immediately and damaging the second Komar. The surviving Syrian Komar tried to escape, but it ran aground in shallow water and was destroyed by 76mm cannon fire at 00:26 hours.

During this naval clash, other Syrian missile boats launched missiles from within the port limits of Latakia (actually launched while the missile boats were moored between merchant ships in port). However, these missiles malfunctioned or lost guidance, and two foreign (one Greek and one Japanese) merchant vessels anchored along the [[pier]]s were hit.  Both vessels were struck in the engine rooms.

The [[Syrian Navy]] remained bottled up in its [[home port]]s for the rest of the war.

While the  Battle of Latakia was the first naval battle in history between missile boats, it was not the first incident in which a missile boat sank another ship using missiles. That had happened when two [[Egyptian Navy]] Komar-class missile boats sank the British-built Israeli [[destroyer]] [[HMS Zealous (R39)#Service as Eilat|''Eilat'']] on 21 October 1967, shortly after the [[Six-Day War]], using four [[P-15 Termit]] surface-to-surface missiles.<ref>{{Citation |title=Cruise Missiles |first=Richard K |last=Betts |page=381 |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |year=1982}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation |first=Saad |last=El Shzly |page=23 |title=The Crossing of the Suez}}.</ref>
