{{Campaignbox Three Kingdoms}}
The '''Battle of Xiaoting'''（猇亭之戰）, also known as the '''Battle of Yiling''' and the '''Battle of Yiling and Xiaoting''', was fought between the state of [[Shu Han|Shu]] and the state of [[Eastern Wu|Wu]], between the years 221 and 222 in the early [[Three Kingdoms]] period of China. The battle is significant because Wu was able to turn the situation from a series of initial losses into a defensive stalemate, before proceeding to win a decisive victory over Shu. The Wu victory halted the Shu invasion and preceded the death of [[Liu Bei]], Shu's founding emperor.

==Background==
{{further|Lü Meng's invasion of Jing Province|End of the Han dynasty}}

In late 219, [[Lü Meng]], a general serving under [[Sun Quan]], led an army to invade [[Liu Bei]]'s territories in southern [[Jing Province]]. [[Guan Yu]], Liu Bei's general in charge of guarding Jing Province, was away at the [[Battle of Fancheng]] and did not know about the invasion until after he returned from his Pyrrhic victory at Fancheng. He was surrounded by Sun Quan's forces in Maicheng (麥城; in [[Dangyang]], Hubei), captured in an ambush while trying to break out of the siege, and eventually executed by Sun Quan's forces in Linju (臨沮; present-day [[Nanzhang County]], Hubei).<ref>(權已據江陵，盡虜羽士衆妻子，羽軍遂散。權遣將逆擊羽，斬羽及子平于臨沮。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 36.</ref>

On 25 November 220, [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]], the figurehead monarch of the [[Eastern Han dynasty]], abdicated in favour of [[Cao Pi]] and ended the Eastern Han dynasty. On 11 December, Cao Pi established the state of [[Cao Wei|Wei]] to replace the Eastern Han dynasty and became its first emperor.<ref>(冬，十月，乙卯，漢帝告祠高廟，使行御史大夫張音持節奉璽綬詔冊，禪位于魏。王三上書辭讓，乃為壇於繁陽，辛未，升壇受璽綬，卽皇帝位，燎祭天地、嶽瀆，改元，大赦。) ''Zizhi Tongjian'' vol. 69.</ref> On 10 May 221, Liu Bei declared himself emperor<ref>(夏，四月，丙午，漢中王卽皇帝位於武擔之南，大赦，改元章武。以諸葛亮為丞相，許靖為司徒。) ''Zizhi Tongjian'' vol. 69.</ref><ref>([建安二十五年]冬，魏嗣王稱尊號，改元為黃初。二年四月，劉備稱帝於蜀。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 47.</ref> and established a new state, historically known as [[Shu Han|Shu]], to contest Cao Pi's claim to the Han throne. Around the same time, Sun Quan shifted the capital of his territories from [[Gong'an County]] to [[Ezhou|E County]], which he renamed "Wuchang" ({{lang|zh|武昌}}).<ref>(孫權自公安徙都鄂，更名鄂曰武昌。) ''Zizhi Tongjian'' vol. 69.</ref> On 23 September 221, Sun Quan pledged allegiance to Cao Pi and became a vassal of the Wei state; in return, Cao Pi awarded Sun Quan the title "King of [[Eastern Wu|Wu]]" ({{lang|zh-Hant|吳王}}).<ref>(八月，孫權遣使稱臣，卑辭奉章，幷送于禁等還。 ... 丁巳，遣太常邢貞奉策卽拜孫權為吳王，加九錫。) ''Zizhi Tongjian'' vol. 69.</ref>

==Prelude==
Liu Bei desired to avenge Guan Yu and take back Jing Province, so he made preparations for war against Sun Quan.<ref>(漢主恥關羽之沒，將擊孫權。) ''Zizhi Tongjian'' vol. 69.</ref> When [[Zhao Yun]], a veteran general under Liu Bei, tried to dissuade his lord from going to war with Sun Quan, Liu Bei ignored him. Later, when Liu Bei launched the campaign against Sun Quan, he did not bring Zhao Yun along and instead left him behind to guard [[Chongqing#History|Jiangzhou]].<ref name="Zhao Yun">(孫權襲荊州，先主大怒，欲討權。雲諫曰：「國賊是曹操，非孫權也，且先滅魏，則吳自服。操身雖斃，子丕篡盜，當因衆心，早圖關中，居河、渭上流以討凶逆，關東義士必裹糧策馬以迎王師。不應置魏，先與吳戰；兵勢一交，不得卒解也。」 ... 先主不聽，遂東征，留雲督江州。先主失利於秭歸，雲進兵至永安，吳軍已退。) ''Zhao Yun Biezhuan'' annotation in ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 36.</ref> [[Qin Mi]], an official under Liu Bei, also advised his lord against going to war with Sun Quan but ended up being thrown into prison.<ref name="Qin Mi">(益州辟宓為從事祭酒。先主旣稱尊號，將東征吳，宓陳天時必無其利，坐下獄幽閉，然後貸出。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 38.</ref>

Liu Bei ordered [[Zhang Fei]] to lead 10,000 troops from [[Langzhong]] to join him at Jiangzhou. During the mobilisation, Zhang Fei was assassinated by his subordinates Fan Qiang ({{lang|zh|范彊}}) and Zhang Da ({{lang|zh-Hant|張達}}), who cut off his head and brought it along with them as they defected to Sun Quan's side. Zhang Fei's adjutant wrote a report to Liu Bei. When Liu Bei heard that Zhang Fei's adjutant sent him a report, he exclaimed: "Oh! (Zhang) Fei is dead."<ref name="Zhang Fei">(先主伐吳，飛當率兵萬人，自閬中會江州。臨發，其帳下將張達、范彊殺飛，持其首，順流而奔孫權。飛營都督表報先主，先主聞飛都督之有表也，曰：「噫！飛死矣。」) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 36.</ref>

In August 221, Liu Bei personally led his army to attack Sun Quan. He also gave higher appointments to some mid-ranking Shu officers from Jing Province, such as [[Feng Xi]] and [[Zhang Nan (Three Kingdoms)|Zhang Nan]], to further raise his army's morale for the campaign. Sun Quan sent [[Zhuge Jin]] as his representative to meet Liu Bei and start peace talks.<ref>(秋，七月，漢主自率諸軍擊孫權，權遣使求和於漢。) ''Zizhi Tongjian'' vol. 69.</ref> When Zhuge Jin met Liu Bei, he said: {{quote|"I heard that your army has come from [[Baidicheng]], and that your subjects have advised you to reject peace talks due to the hostilities between us which arose from the King of Wu's occupation of Jing Province and Guan Yu's death. I am deeply worried because such thinking shows narrow-mindedness on their part, as well as their failure to take the bigger picture into consideration. I shall attempt to explain the gravity of the situation to Your Majesty. If Your Majesty can temporarily lower your pride, put aside your anger, and carefully think through what I am about to say, I am sure that Your Majesty will be able to finalise your decision. There will also be no need to seek further counsel from your subjects. Is Your Majesty's relationship with Guan Yu comparable to that with the emperors (of the Han dynasty)? Is one Jing Province comparable to the entire Empire? Between your two enemies, whom do you hate more? If you can answer these questions, then I am sure it won't be difficult for you to finalise your decision."<ref>(瑾與備牋曰：「奄聞旗鼓來至白帝，或恐議臣以吳王侵取此州，危害關羽，怨深禍大，不宜荅和，此用心於小，未留意於大者也。試為陛下論其輕重，及其大小。陛下若抑威損忿，蹔省瑾言者，計可立決，不復咨之於羣后也。陛下以關羽之親何如先帝？荊州大小孰與海內？俱應仇疾，誰當先後？若審此數，易於反掌。」) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 52.</ref>}} Liu Bei refused to listen to him.<ref>(漢主不聽。) ''Zizhi Tongjian'' vol. 69.</ref>

===Opening moves===
In August 221, Liu Bei sent his generals [[Wu Ban]] and [[Feng Xi]] to attack the Wu positions at the [[Wu Gorge]], which were guarded by Li Yi ({{lang|zh|李異}}) and Liu E ({{lang|zh-Hant|劉阿}}). After Wu Ban and Feng Xi achieved success, the Shu army, comprising over 50,000 troops, advanced further to [[Zigui County]]. Liu Bei also sent messengers to request reinforcements from the local tribes in [[Wuling Commandery]] (武陵郡).<ref name="ZZTJ: Shu strength">([秋，七月， ...] 漢主遣將軍吳班、馮習攻破權將李異、劉阿等於巫，進兵秭歸，兵四萬餘人。武陵蠻夷皆遣使往請兵。) ''Zizhi Tongjian'' vol. 69.</ref><ref>(初，先主忿孫權之襲關羽，將東征，秋七月，遂帥諸軍伐吳。孫權遣書請和，先主盛怒不許，吳將陸議、李異、劉阿等屯巫、秭歸；將軍吳班、馮習自巫攻破異等，軍次秭歸，武陵五谿蠻夷遣使請兵。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 32.</ref> At Zigui, Liu Bei met up with [[Liao Hua]], a former subordinate of Guan Yu. Liao Hua became a prisoner-of-war in Wu after Guan Yu's death but managed to escape and make his way back to Shu. Liu Bei appointed him as the Administrator of [[Yidu, Hubei|Yidu]].<ref name="Liao Hua">(為前將軍關羽主簿，羽敗，屬吳。思歸先主，乃詐死，時人謂為信然，因携持老母晝夜西行。會先主東征，遇於秭歸。先主大恱，以化為宜都太守。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 45.</ref>

In response to the Shu invasion, Sun Quan appointed [[Lu Xun (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Xun]] as his Grand Chief Controller ({{lang|zh|大都督}}) and ordered him to lead 50,000 troops to resist the enemy. Lu Xun had under his command several Wu officers such as [[Zhu Ran]],<ref name="Zhu Ran" /> [[Pan Zhang]],<ref name="Pan Zhang" /> [[Song Qian (Eastern Wu)|Song Qian]],<ref name="Song Qian" /> [[Han Dang]],<ref name="Han Dang">(... 遷偏將軍，領永昌太守。宜都之役，與陸遜、朱然等共攻蜀軍於涿鄉，大破之，徙威烈將軍，封都亭侯。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 55.</ref> [[Xu Sheng]],<ref name="Xu Sheng">(後遷建武將軍，封都亭侯，領廬江太守，賜臨城縣為奉邑。劉備次西陵，盛攻取諸屯，所向有功。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 55.</ref> Xianyu Dan ({{lang|zh|鮮于丹}}), and [[Sun Huan (Shuwu)|Sun Huan]].<ref name="ZZTJ: Wu strength">([秋，七月， ...] 權以鎮西將軍陸遜為大都督、假節，督將軍朱然、潘璋、宋謙、韓當、徐盛、鮮于丹、孫桓等五萬人拒之。) ''Zizhi Tongjian'' vol. 69.</ref><ref name="Lu Xun oversaw...">(黃武元年，劉備率大衆來向西界，權命遜為大都督、假節，督朱然、潘璋、宋謙、韓當、徐盛、鮮于丹、孫桓等五萬人拒之。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 58.</ref><ref name="Sun Huan" />

===The Shu army's approach===
In February 222, Liu Bei planned to lead his army from Zigui（秭歸）further into Jing Province to reclaim the province. However, the Shu general [[Huang Quan (general)|Huang Quan]] noted that the Wu forces were powerful and had used the [[Yangtze]] to their advantage, so he volunteered to lead the attack and suggested that Liu Bei remain behind as backup. Liu Bei refused to listen to him, appointed him as General Who Guards the North ({{lang|zh-Hant|鎮北將軍}}), and put him in charge of a separate Shu army to defend the northern flank (the northern bank of the Yangtze) from any possible attack by Wei forces. He then personally led the main Shu army, which travelled along the southern bank of the Yangtze.<ref name="Huang Quan advising Liu Bei">(及稱尊號，將東伐吳，權諫曰：「吳人悍戰，又水軍順流，進易退難，臣請為先驅以甞寇，陛下宜為後鎮。」先主不從，以權為鎮北將軍，督江北軍以防魏師；先主自在江南。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 43.</ref>

Liu Bei also ordered [[Wu Ban]] (吳班) and [[Chen Shi (Three Kingdoms)|Chen Shi]] （陳式）to lead the Shu navy to [[Yichang#History|Yiling]] on the banks of the Yangtze. In the meantime, he also sent [[Ma Liang (Three Kingdoms)|Ma Liang]] as an envoy to meet the tribes in Wuling Commandery and seek to bribe their chiefs with money and official titles to win their support.<ref name="Ma Liang">(先主稱尊號，以良為侍中。及東征吳，遣良入武陵招納五溪蠻夷，蠻夷渠帥皆受印號，咸如意指。會先主敗績於夷陵，良亦遇害。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 39.</ref><ref name="Wu Ban, Chen Shi">(二年春正月，先主軍還秭歸，將軍吳班、陳式水軍屯夷陵，夾江東西岸。二月，先主自秭歸率諸將進軍，緣山截嶺，於夷道猇亭駐營，自佷山通武陵，遣侍中馬良安慰五谿蠻夷，咸相率響應。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 32.</ref> As the tribes in Wuling grew restless upon the Shu army's approach, Sun Quan sent [[Bu Zhi]] to guard [[Yiyang]] and deal with any unrest.<ref name="Bu Zhi">(隲因承制遣使宣恩撫納，是加拜平戎將軍，封廣信侯。 ... 會劉備東下，武陵蠻夷蠢動，權遂命隲上益陽。備旣敗績，而零、桂諸郡猶相驚擾，處處阻兵；隲周旋征討，皆平之。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 52.</ref>

When Wu generals wanted to attack the Shu army as it approached,<ref>(吳書曰：諸將並欲迎擊備， ...) ''Wu Shu'' annotation in ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 58.</ref> Lu Xun objected and said: {{quote|"Liu Bei is leading an army east to attack us and his army's morale is very high. Besides, his forces are based in high and mountainous terrain, so it's difficult for us to attack them. Even if we manage to win, we cannot completely defeat them. If we suffer any setback, our morale will be greatly affected and this isn't a small issue. Now, we should raise our troops' morale and make plans while waiting for changes in the situation. If we're on plains and flat ground, we should be worrying about sustaining heavy losses in skirmishes and charges. However, since the enemy is on mountainous terrain, they cannot conduct an all-out assault because they are sandwiched between wood and rocks. We should take advantage of this weakness of theirs."<ref>(... 遜以為不可，曰：「備舉軍東下，銳氣始盛，且乘高守險，難可卒攻，攻之縱下，猶難盡克，若有不利，損我大勢，非小故也。今但且獎厲將士，廣施方略，以觀其變。若此間是平原曠野，當恐有顛沛交馳之憂，今緣山行軍，勢不得展，自當罷於木石之間，徐制其弊耳。」) ''Wu Shu'' annotation in ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 58.</ref>}} The Wu generals did not understand Lu Xun's reasoning and thought that he feared the enemy so they were very unhappy with him.<ref>(諸將不解，以為遜畏之，各懷憤恨。) ''Wu Shu'' annotation in ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 58.</ref>

===Stalemate===
The Shu army passed through the [[Wu Gorge]], Jianping ({{lang|zh|建平}}), Lianping ({{lang|zh|連平}}), and Lianwei ({{lang|zh|連圍}}), and arrived at the border of Yiling, where they constructed about 10 fortified garrisons. Liu Bei appointed [[Feng Xi]] as the Grand Controller ({{lang|zh|大督}}), [[Zhang Nan (Three Kingdoms)|Zhang Nan]] as the vanguard commander ({{lang|zh|前部督}}), and [[Yang Xi (Three Kingdoms)#Notes|Fu Kuang]], Zhao Rong ({{lang|zh-Hant|趙融}}), [[Liao Hua]], and [[Fu Rong (Three Kingdoms)|Fu Rong]] as detachment commanders ({{lang|zh|別督}}). The Shu and Wu forces were locked in a stalemate for about six months from February to July 222.<ref>(漢人自巫峽建平連營至夷陵界，立數十屯，以馮習為大督，張南為前部督，自正月與吳相拒，至六月不決。) ''Zizhi Tongjian'' vol. 69.</ref>

Liu Bei ordered Wu Ban to lead a few thousand soldiers out of the mountainous regions to set up camps on flat terrain and provoke the Wu forces to attack them.<ref name="Liu Bei led Feng Xi, Zhang Nan...">(備從巫峽、建平、連平、連圍至夷陵界，立數十屯，以金錦爵賞誘動諸夷，使將軍馮習為大督，張南為前部，輔匡、趙融、廖淳、傅肜等各為別督，先遣吳班將數千人於平地立營，欲以挑戰。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 58.</ref> When the Wu officers wanted to respond to the taunts and attack the enemy, Lu Xun said: "This must be a trick. We should observe first."<ref>(諸將皆欲擊之，遜曰：「此必有譎，且觀之。」) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 58.</ref>

As Lu Xun suspected, there were actually 8,000 Shu troops waiting in ambush in the nearby valleys. Since the Wu forces did not respond to the taunts, Liu Bei abandoned his plan to lure the enemy into the ambush and ordered the 8,000 soldiers to come out of the valleys. When Lu Xun heard about it, he told the Wu officers: "The reason why I did not follow your suggestions to attack the enemy is because I suspected there was something fishy about it." He then wrote a memorial to Sun Quan to emphasize the strategic importance of Yiling, point out some of Liu Bei's weaknesses, and reassure Sun Quan that he would defeat the enemy.<ref>(備知其計不可，乃引伏兵八千，從谷中出。遜曰：「所以不聽諸君擊班者，揣之必有巧故也。」遜上疏曰：「夷陵要害，國之關限，雖為易得，亦復易失。失之非徒損一郡之地，荊州可憂。今日爭之，當令必諧。備干天常，不守窟穴，而敢自送。臣雖不材，憑奉威靈，以順討逆，破壞在近。尋備前後行軍，多敗少成，推此論之，不足為戚。臣初嫌之，水陸俱進，今反舍船就步，處處結營，察其布置，必無他變。伏願至尊高枕，不以為念也。」) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 58.</ref>

===The Wu counter-attack and the burning of the Shu camps===
Several days later, the Wu officers told Lu Xun: {{quote|"We should have attacked Liu Bei in the initial stages. Now, he has advanced further in by 500 to 600 ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' and we have been locked in a stalemate for seven to eight months. He has reinforced all his crucial positions, so even if we attack them it will yield nothing."<ref>(諸將並曰：「攻備當在初，今乃令入五六百里，相銜持經七八月，其諸要害皆以固守，擊之必無利矣。」) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 58.</ref>}} Lu Xun replied: {{quote|"Liu Bei is cunning and experienced. In the initial stage, his army was very focused and its morale was very high, so we could not defeat them then. Now, however, since it has been quite some time, they are already weary, low on morale, and out of ideas. Now is the time for us to launch a multi-pronged assault on them."<ref>(遜曰：「備是猾虜，更甞事多，其軍始集，思慮精專，未可干也。今住已乆，不得我便，兵疲意沮，計不復生，犄角此寇，正在今日。」) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 58.</ref>}}

Lu Xun then targeted one enemy camp and attacked it but failed to capture it. The Wu officers complained: "We are sacrificing our soldiers' lives for nothing." Lu Xun replied: "I have devised a strategy for defeating the enemy." He then ordered his men to carry a pile of straw each and launch a fire attack on the enemy. Upon the commencement of the fire attack, Lu Xun led all the Wu units on an all-out assault on the Shu forces.<ref>(乃先攻一營，不利。諸將皆曰：「空殺兵耳。」遜曰：「吾已曉破之之術。」乃勑各持一把茅，以火攻拔之。一爾勢成，通率諸軍同時俱攻， ...)

===Liu Bei's retreat to Baidicheng===
Liu Bei and his remaining troops retreated to the Ma'an Hills (馬鞍山; east of present-day [[Changyang Tujia Autonomous County|Changyang County]], [[Hubei]]),<ref name="Geographical Investigation of Ma'an Mountain in the Three Kingdoms Yiling Battle" /> where they continued to be fiercely assaulted by the Wu forces from all directions. At the same time, landslides occurred at the Ma'an Hills and caused the Shu forces to sustain thousands of casualties. The Wu general [[Sun Huan (Shuwu)|Sun Huan]] fought with his life and managed to break through enemy lines and capture the key positions in the hills.

Liu Bei regrouped his scattered forces and ordered them to abandon their boats and travel on foot towards [[Fengjie County|Yufu County]], which he renamed "Yong'an" (永安; literally "everlasting peace"). The Wu officers Li Yi ({{lang|zh|李異}}) and Liu E ({{lang|zh-Hant|劉阿}}) led their troops in pursuit of Liu Bei and garrisoned at Nanshan ({{lang|zh|南山}}). In late September or early October 222, Liu Bei and his forces retreated further to the [[Wu Gorge]].<ref name="Yong'an ...

By the time Liu Bei reached the safety of [[Baidicheng]], all his boats, military equipment, and supplies had been captured by Wu forces. The dead bodies of Shu soldiers floated in the river and obstructed its flow. Liu Bei was extremely upset and furious with his defeat. He exclaimed: "Is it not the will of Heaven that I must be humiliated by Lu Xun?"<ref>(... 僅得入白帝城。其舟船器械，水步軍資，一時略盡，尸骸漂流，塞江而下。備大慙恚，曰：「吾乃為遜所折辱，豈非天邪！」) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 58.</ref> When [[Zhao Yun]] showed up at Yong'an with reinforcements from Jiangzhou, the pursuing Wu forces had already retreated on their own.<ref name="Zhao Yun" />

==Incidents during the battle==

===Lu Xun refusing to help Sun Huan===
In the earlier stages of the battle, [[Sun Huan (Shuwu)|Sun Huan]] led a separate force to attack the Shu vanguard force at [[Yidu|Yidao]] but ended up being besieged by the enemy. He requested for reinforcements from Lu Xun but was denied. The other Wu officers told Lu Xun: "General Sun is a relative of our lord. He is currently under siege, so shouldn't we help him?" Lu Xun replied: "He has the support of his men, his base is well defended, and he has sufficient supplies. There is nothing to worry about. When my plans are in motion, even if we don't help him, the siege on him will automatically be lifted." After the Wu victory at Xiaoting, Sun Huan came to see Lu Xun and said: "Earlier on, I was indeed very resentful when you refused to help me. But now, after the victory, I see that you have your own way of doing things."<ref>(初，孫桓別討備前鋒於夷道，為備所圍，求救於遜。遜曰：「未可。」諸將曰：「孫安東公族，見圍已困，柰何不救？」遜曰：「安東得士衆心，城牢糧足，無可憂也。待吾計展，欲不救安東，安東自解。」及方略大施，備果奔潰。桓後見遜曰：「前實怨不見救，定至今日，乃知調度自有方耳。」) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 58.</ref>

===Wu officers' reluctance to follow Lu Xun's orders===
Many of the Wu officers who participated in the battle had either served in Wu since [[Sun Ce]]'s time or were relatives of Sun Quan's family, so they viewed themselves highly and were unwilling to follow Lu Xun's orders.<ref>(當禦備時，諸將軍或是孫策時舊將，或公室貴戚，各自矜恃，不相聽從。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 58.</ref> Lu Xun placed his sword on the desk and said: {{quote|"Liu Bei is well known throughout the Empire, and even [[Cao Cao]] feared him. Now, he is at our borders and we have a tough fight ahead. All of you gentlemen have received grace from the State, so you should cooperate harmoniously and work together to defeat the enemy in order to repay the State's kindness. You should not be behaving as you are now. I may be a mere scholar, but I have received orders from our Lord. The reason why the State asks you to lower yourselves and submit to my command is because I have a modicum of value and I can endure humiliation for the sake of fulfilling a greater task. Each of you has your own duties so you cannot excuse yourselves from them! Military rules are long established. You shouldn't break them."<ref>(遜案劒曰：「劉備天下知名，曹操所憚，今在境界，此彊對也。諸君並荷國恩，當相輯睦，共翦此虜，上報所受，而不相順，非所謂也。僕雖書生，受命主上。國家所以屈諸君使相承望者，以僕有尺寸可稱，能忍辱負重故也。各在其事，豈復得辭！軍令有常，不可犯矣。」) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 58.</ref>}}

The Wu officers began to show greater respect for Lu Xun after the Wu victory, which was largely due to his strategies. Lu Xun did not report this incident to Sun Quan, who found out about it himself after the battle. When Sun Quan asked Lu Xun about it, Lu replied that he valued those officers even though they were insubordinate towards him, and decided to put up with them because he felt it was important to maintain good working relationships with them to fulfil their common goal of resisting the Shu invasion. Sun Quan praised him and rewarded him handsomely.<ref>(及至破備，計多出遜，諸將乃服。 ... 權聞之，曰：「君何以初不啟諸將違節度者邪？」遜對曰：「受恩深重，任過其才。又此諸將或任腹心，或堪爪牙，或是功臣，皆國家所當與共克定大事者。臣雖駑懦，竊慕相如、寇恂相下之義，以濟國事。」權大笑稱善，加拜遜輔國將軍，領荊州牧，即改封江陵侯。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 58.</ref>

===Heroics of Fu Rong and Cheng Ji===
[[Fu Rong (Three Kingdoms)|Fu Rong]] volunteered to cover the rear while the Shu forces were retreating from Yiling and Xiaoting. He continued to hold his ground firmly and vent his fury on the enemy even though all his comrades had already been killed. When the Wu soldiers called for him to surrender, he replied: "Dogs of Wu! Do you think a Han officer will ever surrender?" He was eventually killed in action.<ref name="SGZ vol 45: Feng Xi, Zhang Nan and Fu Rong">(休元名習，南郡人。隨先主入蜀。先主東征吳，習為領軍，統諸軍，大敗於猇亭。 ... 文進名南，亦自荊州隨先主入蜀，領兵從先主征吳，與習俱死。時又有義陽傅肜，先主退軍，斷後拒戰，兵人死盡，吳將語肜令降，肜罵曰：「吳狗！何有漢將軍降者！」遂戰死。) Pei Songzhi's annotation in ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 45.</ref>

[[Cheng Ji (Shu Han)|Cheng Ji]] also covered the rear during the Shu retreat. As the enemy approached, someone urged him to abandon his boat and escape, but he replied: "I have never fled from battle throughout my military career. Besides, the Emperor is currently in a dangerous situation." When the Wu forces showed up, Cheng Ji wielded a ''[[Ji (halberd)|ji]]'', fought fiercely and managed to sink some enemy boats before he was eventually overwhelmed by the enemy and killed.<ref name="Cheng Ji">(季然名畿，巴西閬中人也。 ... 先主領益州牧，辟為從事祭酒。後隨先主征吳，遇大軍敗績，泝江而還，或告之曰：「後追已至，解船輕去，乃可以免。」畿曰：「吾在軍，未曾為敵走，況從天子而見危哉！」追人遂及畿船，畿身執戟戰，敵船有覆者。衆大至，共擊之，乃死。) Pei Songzhi's annotation in ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 45.</ref>

===Cao Pi foreseeing Liu Bei's defeat===
When [[Cao Pi]] received news that the Shu forces had set up linked camps over a distance of more than 700 ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'',<ref>(初，帝聞漢兵樹柵連營七百餘里， ...) ''Zizhi Tongjian'' vol. 69.</ref> he told his subjects: {{quote|"(Liu) Bei does not know military strategy. How can anyone fight a war with camps laid out over a distance of 700 ''li''? 'A person who deploys troops in forested and damp areas with obstacles is bound to be captured by the enemy.' This is something to be avoided in war. I will hear from Sun Quan very soon."<ref>(... 謂羣臣曰：「備不曉兵，豈有七百里營可以拒敵者乎！『苞原隰險阻而為軍者為敵所禽』，此兵忌也。孫權上事今至矣。」) ''Zizhi Tongjian'' vol. 69.</ref>}} He received a report about the Wu victory seven days later.<ref>(後七日，吳破漢書到。) ''Zizhi Tongjian'' vol. 69.</ref>

==Aftermath==
{{see also|Cao Pi's invasions of Eastern Wu}}

[[Huang Quan (general)|Huang Quan]] and the separate Shu army on the northern bank of the [[Yangtze]] were cut off from the main Shu army during the Wu counterattack and could not return to Shu. In desperation, Huang Quan and his subordinate [[Pang Tong#Family and descendants|Pang Lin]] led their troops to defect to Wei.<ref name="Huang Quan defecting to Wei">(及吳將軍陸議乘流斷圍，南軍敗績，先主引退。而道隔絕，權不得還，故率將所領降于魏。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 43.</ref><ref name="Pang Lin">(統弟林，以荊州治中從事參鎮北將軍黃權征吳，值軍敗，隨權入魏， ...) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 37.</ref>

Small rebellions broke out in [[Lingling Commandery|Lingling]] (零陵) and [[Guiyng Commandery|Guiyang]] (桂陽) commanderies after the Shu forces retreated. [[Bu Zhi]], who was stationed at [[Yiyang]] before the battle, led Wu forces to suppress them.<ref name="Bu Zhi" />

After the battle, [[Xu Sheng]], [[Pan Zhang]], [[Song Qian (Eastern Wu)|Song Qian]] and other Wu officers suggested attacking Baidicheng to capture Liu Bei. When Sun Quan asked Lu Xun for his opinion, Lu Xun, [[Zhu Ran]] and [[Luo Tong]] said that when [[Cao Pi]] amassed his forces and seemed like he was going to help Wu attack Shu, he actually had sinister intentions. They cautioned Sun Quan about this and suggested to abandon their pursuit of Liu Bei and return to Wu. Sun Quan heeded their advice. Not long later, Cao Pi led the Wei armies to [[Cao Pi's invasions of Eastern Wu|invade Wu]] from three directions.<ref>(又備旣住白帝，徐盛、潘璋、宋謙等各競表言備必可禽，乞復攻之。權以問遜，遜與朱然、駱統以為曹丕大合士衆，外託助國討備，內實有姦心，謹決計輒還。無幾，魏軍果出，三方受敵也。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 58.</ref>

When Liu Bei heard of the Wei invasion of Wu, he wrote to Lu Xun: {{quote|"The enemy (Wei) is at Jiangling now. If I launch another attack again, in your opinion, do you think I will succeed?"<ref>(吳錄曰：劉備聞魏軍大出，書與遜云：「賊今已在江陵，吾將復東，將軍謂其能然不？」) ''Wu Lu'' annotation in ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 58.</ref>}} Lu Xun replied: {{quote|"I am afraid your army has recently suffered defeats and has yet to recover. Now is the time for you to make reconciliations, rest and recuperate. This is not the time for you to launch another assault on us again. However, if you do not consider carefully and plan to dispatch all your remaining forces on another attack, I assure you none of those you send here will return alive."<ref>(遜荅曰：「但恐軍新破，創痍未復，始求通親，且當自補，未暇窮兵耳。若不惟筭，欲復以傾覆之餘，遠送以來者，無所逃命。」) ''Wu Lu'' annotation in ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 58.</ref>}}

Liu Bei became critically ill in April 223. Before he died on 10 June, he named his son [[Liu Shan]] as his successor and appointed [[Zhuge Liang]] and [[Li Yan (Three Kingdoms)|Li Yan]] as regents to assist Liu Shan. After taking over the reins of power, Zhuge Liang made peace with Wu and re-established the Wu–Shu alliance against Wei.<ref>(先主病篤，託孤於丞相亮，尚書令李嚴為副。夏四月癸巳，先主殂于永安宮，時年六十三。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 32.</ref><ref>(備尋病亡，子禪襲位，諸葛亮秉政，與權連和。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 58.</ref>

==In ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms''==
{{see also|List of fictitious stories in Romance of the Three Kingdoms}}

The events before, during, and after the Battle of Xiaoting are mentioned in chapters 81–84 of the 14th-century historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' (''Sanguo Yanyi'') by [[Luo Guanzhong]]. Some fictitious stories were included and actual events were exaggerated for dramatic effect. The following are some notable events related to the battle, as described in the novel:

===Opposition to Liu Bei's decision to go to war===
Liu Bei plans to go to war with Sun Quan to avenge Guan Yu and retake [[Jing Province]], but his decision is opposed by many of his subjects. The first person who attempts to dissuade him from going to war is [[Zhao Yun]], who is ignored.<ref>(說先主起兵東征。趙雲諫曰： ... 遂不聽趙雲之諫，下令起兵伐吳；) ''Sanguo Yanyi'' ch. 81.</ref> After that, other Shu officials such as [[Ma Liang (Three Kingdoms)|Ma Liang]] and [[Chen Zhen (Three Kingdoms)|Chen Zhen]] urge [[Zhuge Liang]] to stop Liu Bei, so Zhuge Liang brings them along to meet Liu Bei and advise him against his decision, but Liu Bei refuses to accept their advice. Just when Liu Bei is preparing for war, [[Qin Mi]] opposes his decision. Liu Bei is so angry that he wants to execute Qin Mi. However, Qin Mi is spared after Zhuge Liang and the rest of the Shu imperial court plead with Liu Bei. Zhuge Liang then writes a [[Memorial to the throne|memorial]] to Liu Bei to explain why he should not go to war with Sun Quan, but Liu Bei throws the memorial to the ground after reading it and exclaims, "My decision is final. There is no need to advise me against my decision anymore!"<ref>(當下孔明引百官來奏先主曰： ... 次日，先生整兵要行。學士秦宓奏曰： ... 孔明聞知，即上表救秦宓。其略曰： ... 先主看畢，擲表於地曰：「朕意已決，無得再諫！」) ''Sanguo Yanyi'' ch. 81.</ref>

;Historicity
The historical text ''Sanguozhi'' did not mention anything about Zhuge Liang opposing Liu Bei's decision to go to war with Sun Quan. However, it did mention that Zhao Yun and Qin Mi attempted to dissuade Liu Bei: Zhao Yun advised Liu Bei against attacking Sun Quan, but was ignored.<ref name="Zhao Yun" /> Qin Mi was imprisoned by Liu Bei when he advised him against the campaign, but was released later.<ref name="Qin Mi" />

===Huang Zhong's death===
The Shu general [[Huang Zhong]] participates in the campaign even though he is already over 70 years old at the time. He slays [[Pan Zhang]]'s subordinate, Shi Ji ({{lang|zh|史蹟}}), and defeats Pan Zhang in an engagement on the first day. On the second day, while pursuing the retreating Pan Zhang, he falls into an ambush and is surrounded by [[Zhou Tai]], [[Han Dang]], [[Ling Tong]] and Pan Zhang. He is hit by an arrow fired by Ma Zhong ({{lang|zh-Hant|馬忠}}). [[Guan Xing]] and [[Zhang Bao (Shu Han)|Zhang Bao]] save him, but he dies from his wound that night. Liu Bei mourns his death. Since the Battle of Xiaoting historically took place between 221–222, going by the novel's account, Huang Zhong's year of death should be around 221–222.<ref>(卻說章武二年春正月， ... 言訖，不省人事，是夜殞於御營。 ... 先主見黃忠氣絕，哀傷不已，敕具棺槨，葬於成都。) ''Sanguo Yanyi'' ch. 83.</ref>

;Historicity
Huang Zhong's biography in the ''Sanguozhi'' stated that Huang Zhong died in 220, a year after the [[Hanzhong Campaign]] ended. His cause of death is unknown.<ref>(建安二十四年， ... 明年卒，...) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 36.</ref>

===Guan Xing killing Pan Zhang===
In one of the early engagements, [[Guan Xing]] encounters [[Pan Zhang]], who captured his father [[Guan Yu]] in an ambush during [[Lü Meng's invasion of Jing Province|the Battle of Maicheng]]. In his eagerness to avenge his father, Guan Xing pursues Pan Zhang into a valley but loses his way inside. After nightfall, Guan Xing wanders around until he finds a house inhabited by an old man and stays there for the night. He sees his father's portrait on the wall in the house. Later that night, Pan Zhang also finds his way to the house and asks to stay there. Guan Xing sees Pan Zhang and shouts at him. Just as Pan Zhang is about to leave, he encounters Guan Yu's ghost and is petrified. Guan Xing catches up with Pan Zhang, kills him, digs out his heart and places it on the altar as an offering to his father's spirit.<ref>(原來關興殺入吳陣，正遇讎人潘璋，驟馬追之。 ... 早被關興手起劍落，斬於地上，取心瀝血，就關公神像前祭祀。) ''Sanguo Yanyi'' ch. 83.</ref>

;Historicity
Pan Zhang's biography in the ''Sanguozhi'' stated that he died in 234 – more than 10 years after the Battle of Xiaoting. His cause of death is unknown.<ref>(嘉禾三年卒。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 55.</ref> Guan Yu's biography mentioned that Guan Xing served as a civil official in Shu after reaching adulthood (around the age of 19) and died a few years later while in office,<ref>(子興嗣。興字安國，少有令問，丞相諸葛亮深器異之。弱冠為侍中、中監軍，數歲卒。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 36.</ref> so Guan Xing was most probably not involved in the battle.

===Gan Ning's death===
[[Gan Ning]] is down with [[dysentery]] around the time of the Battle of Xiaoting, but he still participates in the battle regardless of his illness. He is resting when he hears enemy forces approaching, so he quickly mounts his horse and prepares for battle. He encounters a group of tribal warriors led by [[Shamoke]]. He sees that the enemy force is too large and decides to withdraw. While retreating on horseback, Gan Ning is hit in the head by an arrow fired by Shamoke. He flees, with the arrow still embedded in his head, reaches Fuchi (富池; in present-day [[Yangxin County, Hubei]]), sits down under a tree and dies. Dozens of crows on the tree fly around his body. When Sun Quan learns of Gan Ning's death, he is deeply saddened and gives orders for Gan to be buried with full honours.<ref>(卻說甘寧正在船中養病，聽知蜀兵大至，火急上馬，正遇一彪蠻兵，人皆披髮跣足，皆使弓弩長鎗，搪牌刀斧；為首乃是番王沙摩柯，生得面如噀血，碧眼突出，使兩個鐵蒺藜骨朵，腰帶兩張弓，威風抖擻。甘寧見其勢大，不敢交鋒，撥馬而走；被沙摩柯一箭射中頭顱。寧帶箭而走，到得富池口，坐於大樹之下而死。樹上群鴉數百，圍繞其屍。吳王聞之，哀痛不已，具禮厚葬，立廟祭祀。) ''Sanguo Yanyi'' ch. 83.</ref>

;Historicity
No details were provided on Gan Ning's cause and time of death in his biography in the ''Sanguozhi''. Gan Ning's death was briefly stated as follows: When Gan Ning died, Sun Quan deeply lamented his death.<ref>(寧卒，權痛惜之。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 55.</ref>

===Zhao Yun killing Zhu Ran===
Liu Bei retreats under the protection of [[Guan Xing]] and [[Zhang Bao (Shu Han)|Zhang Bao]] after his camps are set on fire by the Wu forces, who continue to pursue him. At a critical moment, Zhao Yun shows up and blocks the attacks from the enemy. Zhao Yun encounters [[Zhu Ran]] during the battle and kills him. He protects Liu Bei while the latter heads towards [[Baidicheng]].<ref>(雲正殺之間，忽遇朱然，便與交鋒；不一合，一鎗刺朱然於馬下，殺散吳兵，救出先主，望白帝城而走。) ''Sanguo Yanyi'' ch. 84.</ref>

;Historicity
The ''Zhao Yun Biezhuan'' stated that Zhao Yun did not participate in the Battle of Xiaoting. Before the battle, Zhao Yun advised Liu Bei against going to war with Sun Quan but was ignored. Liu Bei ordered him to remain behind and guard Jiangzhou. When Zhao Yun learnt that Liu Bei had been defeated at Zigui, he led troops from Jiangzhou to Yong'an to help his lord.<ref name="Zhao Yun" />

Zhu Ran's biography in the ''Sanguozhi'' stated that he died in 249 at the age of 68 (by [[East Asian age reckoning]]) – about 27 years after the Battle of Xiaoting.<ref>(年六十八，赤烏十二年卒，...) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 56.</ref> Besides, he outlived Zhao Yun, who historically died in 229.<ref>([建興]七年卒，追謚順平侯。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 36.</ref>

===Lady Sun's death===
News of [[Liu Bei]]'s defeat in the battle reach his ex-wife [[Lady Sun]], who had returned to Wu. After hearing rumours that Liu Bei had been killed in battle, Lady Sun ventures out to the bank of the [[Yangtze]], where she faces the west and cries before drowning herself.<ref>(時孫夫人在吳，聞猇亭兵敗，訛傳先主死於軍中，遂驅車至江邊，望西遙哭，投江而死。) ''Sanguo Yanyi'' ch. 84.</ref>

;Historicity
Nothing was recorded in history about what happened to Lady Sun after she left Liu Bei and returned to Wu territory.

===Lu Xun's encounter with Zhuge Liang's Stone Sentinel Maze===
{{main|Stone Sentinel Maze#Lu Xun's encounter}}

==In popular culture==
The battle is featured as a playable stage in [[Koei]]'s video game series ''[[Dynasty Warriors]]'', in which it is known as the "Battle of Yi Ling" or "Battle of Yiling". It has a follow-up, the "Battle of Baidi Castle", which is based on a hypothetical scenario of the Wu forces pressing on to attack [[Baidicheng]], where the Shu forces retreated to after their defeat.
