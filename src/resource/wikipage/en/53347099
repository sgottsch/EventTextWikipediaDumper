"'''Green Light'''" is a song by New Zealand singer and songwriter [[Lorde]]. It was released on 2 March 2017 through [[Universal Music New Zealand]] as the lead single from her upcoming sophomore album, ''[[Melodrama (Lorde album)|Melodrama]]'' (2017). Lorde co-wrote and co-produced the song with [[Jack Antonoff]], with additional writing from [[Joel Little]] and production assistance from [[Frank Dukes]].<ref name="Pitchfork" />

==Background and release==
Prior to the song's release, Lorde teased the song on her [[Twitter]] account, saying  the "Green Light" would be "different, and kinda unexpected. Complex and funny and sad and joyous and it'll make you DANCE."<ref name="EW" /> Lorde announced the release of the single and its music video on Twitter on 2 March 2017.<ref>https://twitter.com/lorde/status/837378230428430337</ref> Later that day, in a [[Beats 1]] interview with [[Zane Lowe]], she also said: <blockquote>The song is really about those moments kind of immediately after your life changes and about all the silly little things that you gravitate towards. I say, 'She thinks you love the beach, you're such a liar.' What the fuck, she thinks you like the beach?! You don't like the beach! It's those little stupid things. It sounds so happy and then the lyrics are so intense obviously. And I realized I was like, 'how come this thing is coming out so joyous sounding?' And I realized this is that drunk girl at the party dancing around crying about her ex-boyfriend who everyone thinks is a mess. That's her tonight and tomorrow she starts to rebuild. And that's the song for me.<ref name="Pitchfork">{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/68382-lorde-releases-new-song-green-light-and-video-watch/|title=Lorde Releases New Song 'Green Light' and Video: Watch|first=Amy|date=2 March 2017|website=|publisher=[[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 March 2017|author=Phillips}}</ref></blockquote>

In an interview with MTV, she revealed "Green Light"'s piano part was inspired by [[Florence and the Machine]]'s "big, jangly" piano movements.

==Critical reception==
Jason Lipshutz of [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] commended the track, highlighting Lorde's songwriting in particular, "...with ''Green Light'', a comeback single that barges into your heart on its first play, Lorde makes a good case that her songwriting, above all else, is her strongest asset", wrote Lipshutz.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7710023/lorde-green-light-analysis|title=Lorde's 'Green Light': A Brilliant Songwriter Enters Her Prime|work=billboard.com|accessdate=3 March 2017}}</ref> Nolan Feeney of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said of the song pulls "off all of those feelings and sounds without making 'Green Light' feel like it was Frankenstein'd together from a pile of lesser tunes."<ref name="EW">{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/music/2017/03/02/lorde-green-light-ew-review/|title=Lorde 'Green Light': EW Review|first=Nolan|date=2 March 2017|website=[[Entertainment Weekly#Website|Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 March 2017|author=Feeney}}</ref> Hugh McIntyre of ''[[Forbes]]'' said, "the tune sees her shedding the gloom of her previous hits for a more upbeat feeling, one which packs a galloping piano/drum beat build up and a power-pop chorus with a vaguely electronic backbeat."<ref name="Forbes">{{cite web|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2017/03/02/lorde-finally-returns-highly-anticipated-new-single-green-light/#ec96063c052c|title = Lorde Finally Returns With Highly Anticipated New Single 'Green Light'|author = Hugh McIntyre|access-date = 2 March 2017|date = 2 March 2017|publisher = ''[[Forbes]]''}}</ref>

''[[NME]]''{{'}}s Rhian Daly said "the first track from ''Melodrama'' [...] is different and unexpected", noting Lorde sounds "angrier and more theatrical than she did on her 2013 debut.
